</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just back from the <a href="https://www.appliedhologenomicsconference.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Applied Hologenomics Conference in 2024</a>

(See also <a href="https://x.com/search?q=%23AHC2024&amp;src=typed_query" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#AHC2024 on Twitter</a>
) in Copenhagen and
thought to reflect a little on the conference and highlight the bits that
particularly stuck with me.</p>
<p>The first thing I want to say is that a paradigm shift is happening
here.</p>
<p>I think what is happening here is a step away from the reductionist view
of the past that goes beyond the systems biology approach that has been
establishing itself during the last 10-20 years.</p>
<p>While systems biology has been an enormously important step up from the
reductionist view of the past by highlighting the fact that the whole is
more than the sum of its parts, is typically focused on one organism at
a time.</p>
<p>Hologenomics additionally embraces the fact that no organism is living
in complete isolation but rather in a very tight interplay with a
multitude of microorganisms, which have a tremendously important
influence, of which we have only perhaps started to learn about.</p>
<p>Something that highlights this is the fact - as pointed out by Seth
Bordenstein in the closing keynote - that close to 50% of diabetes and a
few other diseases have a direct causal link to the microbiome of the
host.</p>
<p>Seth in his keynote says we are in a third biological epoch (after The
origin of species and the Modern Synthesis), where he went as far as
saying &ldquo;centrality of microbes in biology is far more accurate vision of
nature&rdquo;.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m personally not completely sold on that, I guess I see the
point. In my view though I think the most important thing is to realize
that we are dealing with a &ldquo;system of systems&rdquo;, rather than just the
single systems of individual organisms. Systems-of-systems is also a
well-established engineering discipline which means there might be
opportunities for very important insights by letting these fields
cross-pollinate.</p>
<p>That about the general theme going on here.</p>
<p>Let me then share my very incomplete and randomly selected set of
tidbits, facts and remarks that I found was particularly interesting new
points of insight for my specific interests.</p>
<p>I need to add the additional caveat though that I&rsquo;m not a microbiologist
by training but rather come from a very computationally oriented
background and so do have my own strong biases. There were such a wealth
of interesting material and insights presented here that I can not truly
make justice for, simply because I might not know the field enough to be
able to process it in real time. Thus, the list is by necessity a very
personal and biased one. But sharing it nonetheless:</p>
<ul>
<li>Søren Sørensen mentioned that it is a general challenge to link the
plasmids bacteria carry, to their host bacteria.</li>
<li>There were companies present that have developed solutions for this
though, including <a href="https://phasegenomics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phase Genomics</a>
</li>
<li>Søren also outlined that Bacteroidetes, Escherichia and Klebsiella
are the dominant bacterial hosts for plasmids, where the
Bacteroidetes phylum in particular has very high mobility of
plasmids.</li>
<li>I also talked to representatives <a href="https://clinical-microbiomics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clinical
Microbiomics</a>
 has a platform for
studying microbiomes. It seems to be a little more focused on
research than routine diagnostics though.</li>
<li>Rachel Carmody from Harvard University had a pretty fascinating talk
sharing how people in the industrialized world absorb food mostly in
the small intestine, while in the non-industrial world mostly in the
colon, because of the differences in fiber content (more in the
non-industrial world).</li>
<li>Aviaja Hauptmann from University of Greenland had a very
thought-provoking talk as well, highlighting how the microbiomes of
the indigenous people of Greenland has adapted well to the almost
exclusively meat-based diet. She mentioned the challenges arising
today though, when 80% of food is imported more western style food,
whieh has lead to an explosion in non-communicable diseases. They
now have up toward 10% diabetes.</li>
<li><a href="https://x.com/ivanliachko" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ivan Liachko</a>
 from Phase Genomics
presented about their method for linking phages, plasmids and
antimicrobial resistance genes to hosts. They use formalin to
cross-link sequences close to each other before bacterial cells are
lysed, and then create junctions between those sequences, so that
spatially closely located sequences will be &ldquo;glued&rdquo; together, and
appear together in sequenced reads.</li>
<li>They also say they built the world&rsquo;s largest phage/bacteria
database.</li>
<li>Ivan shared interesting insights about how we can get some of the
benefits of phages without their potential drawbacks, by using
lysins, which are proteins made by the phages, that typically work
around anti-microbial resistance.</li>
<li>Lone Gram from Technical University of Denmark presented some
thought-provoking facts including the huge important of microalgae
(in the oceans), as they produce more than 50% of the oxygen we have
in the athmosphere. She also mentioned that Roseobacter are the most
dominant bacteria of the oceans / marine microbiota.</li>
<li>In the panel discussion there were mostly a lot of discussion about
funding. Lone mentioned a thought-worthy thing though, as she
reflected that we need to get [back] into the proper scientific
loop, producing the data needed for the question at hand (and
perhaps not huge amounts more), not just descriptive science of huge
data sets. I think this is a topic for a whole separate post, if not
series of posts.</li>
<li>Katerina Guschanski from University of Edinburgh had a fantastic
talk and concluded that figuring out how much humans affected the
antimicrobial world requires a temporal approach, since the
antimicrobials already existed in nature). She went on to describe
how they found out that Dental calculus is a great way to study
microbiota of ancient organisms, as this is something you can find
in pretty much any museum animal, and it will be protective enough
to contain a lot of preserved microbiomal DNA. E.g. they have
studied the microbiomes of brown bears in Sweden as the population
was almost put to extinction, and back again, where they saw how
oral diseases were significantly more prevalent in the bears during
the bottleneck.</li>
<li>Antton Alberdi from University of Copenhagen shared about many
interesting things, including the Earth HoloGenome Initiative.</li>
<li>Benjamin Auch from Phase Genomics had an interesting talk and shared
a few interesting remarks, including the fact that we are often
ignoring the phages that also come along when we transplant faeces,
and also that faecal transplants do not eliminate anti-microbial
resistance.</li>
<li>Bryan Wang from University of Copenhagen had a fascinating talk
showing how they were able to study the spatial distribution of
bacteria using a clever new technique, and could show how there is a
large spatial factor in how different bacteria aggregate. That is
different species tend to aggregate in different fashion.</li>
<li>In the end, Seth Bordenstein, Director at the Penn State University
Microbiome Center, as mentioned, had a really though-provoking talk
and concluded that there is a huge shift in our understanding of
biology that is happening now, but how this is not yet reflected in
textbooks. For example the standard biology text-book (Campbell),
does mention microbes in a separate chapter, rather than including
it together with the other content, and not having the holobiont
view. To underscore this he mentioned how some studies show the
microbiome contributes close to 50% to HDL Cholesterol, BMI and
[diabetes?] (Rotschild, 2018 Nature). I haven&rsquo;t been able to
verify this claim yet (perhaps found the wrong paper?) but will see
if I can find it later.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope this gives some slight glimpses of all the good stuff being
presented here. If this is not enough, the recordings of the talks
should start getting published online in the next week.</p>
<p>Overall, I had a great time at the conference. The only thing I realized
was that the focus of the talks were both less focused on clinically
relevant topics and much more biology-oriented rather than
computationally oriented than I was perhaps expecting. This is still OK,
but it means it will take some more mental work for me to translate
these insights into what it might mean in my immediate context as a
rather computationally oriented bioinformatician in clinical
microbiology.</p>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m thankful to the organizers for an inspiring conference
where I learned a lot, and got an updated view of the holobiont!</p>
