<p>There are lots of things that can't be answered by a computer from data
alone. Maybe the majority of what we humans perceive as knowledge is
inferred from a combination of data (simple fact statements about
reality) and rules that tell how facts can be combined together to allow
making <em>implicit</em> knowledge (knowledge that is not persisted as facts
anywhere, but has to be <em>inferred</em> from other facts and rules) become
<em>explicit</em>.</p>
<p>One can easily imagine though, that storing every single piece of
knowledge that could be stated, as an explicit fact, would require more
storage than can probably ever be made available in this universe.</p>
<h3 id="toc1">Simulations can make knowledge explicit, from first princples</h3>
<p>It is not too hard to come up with some processes which are just too
complex and involves too much variability^1^ that it is unrealistic to
try to capture every imaginable state of of that system or process in
explicit facts. Instead we must seek the &quot;first principles&quot; that
define the process, and through <em>simulations</em> make explicit any
knowledge we are looking for, at the time we need it (one can of course
<em>cache</em> often accessed knowledge).</p>
<p>So; Simulations can (temporarily ) <em>make explicit</em>, the knowledge we are
looking for, but which <em>does not</em> exist in explicit form.</p>
<h3 id="toc2">Simulations should be automated</h3>
<p>There are lots of simulation software for biological systems out there
... deterministic, stochastic and agent-based ones to mention a few
categories. The plethora of different systems to choose from does not
make life easier for the bench scientist. And in order to improve that
situation, and provide some automation, a standardized way to deal with
simulations is needed.</p>
<h3 id="toc3">What is done already?</h3>
<p>There are some efforts to increase interoperability, most notably
through the <a href="http://sbml.org/">SBML</a> standard, a standard file format
for molecular biology models (pathways, gene regulatory networks, and
the like). But how to make things more &quot;automatable&quot;, as is one of the
main goals of semantic web?</p>
<p>Interestingly, <a href="http://github.com/egonw">Egon</a> hinted about a <a href="http://neilswainston.blogspot.com/2010/02/computational-tools-for-annotation-of.html">blog
post</a>
about a very semantic annotation of SBML models! Nice indeed that SBML
and semantic tech can now be integrated.</p>
<h3 id="toc4">Still more to do</h3>
<p>I'm thinking whether that is still enough though. If wanting to
automate knowledge discovery using these kind of systems, one needs to
capture in a computer-readable way also the <em>outcome</em> of simulations,
not only the underlying model^2^.</p>
<p>So, all in all, I think there is some work to be done in wrapping
simulation software into a &quot;semantic shell&quot; that knows all it needs to
understand the the language of incoming data (it might even need to be
able to produce such data, from semantic queries), and also can analyze
the simulation results, and provide the questioner with an answer in a
semantic way.</p>
<p>Thus, by <em>wrapping simulations in semantics</em>, one might be able to
<em>automate answering of questionswith no answers</em>! (at least, that's the
idea :) )</p>
<h3 id="update-march-2010-building-blocks-already-there">Update (March 2010): Building blocks already there</h3>
<p>I was at <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">EBI</a> last week for PhD interview. As
kindly hinted to by <a href="http://www.chenli.info/">Chen Li</a>, I learned to
know the <a href="http://www.biomodels.net/">BioModels</a> initiative, which
they're directing in the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/compneur-srv/">Le
Nov√®re</a> group at EBI.</p>
<p>When I wrote the post above, I had not imagined that the building blocks
for this was already done, which is what I realized when looking at the
picture at the bottom of the page on the
<a href="http://www.biomodels.net/">BioModels</a> website.</p>
<p>The BioModels initiative itself (which collects systems biology models
which can be used by others) is highly interesting, but what I found
extra interesting was that obviously they have both <em>data formats</em> and
<em>ontologies</em> for the three main parts which probably need to be
addressed, for wrapping simulations in semantics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Model description (Format: <a href="http://sbml.org/">SBML</a>,
<a href="http://sbgn.org/">SBGN</a> | Ontology:
<a href="http://www.biomodels.net/sbo/">SBO</a>)</li>
<li>Simulation description (Format:
<a href="http://www.biomodels.net/sed-ml/">SED-ML</a> | Ontology:
<a href="http://www.biomodels.net/kisao/">KiSAO</a>)</li>
<li>Simulation results description (Format:
<a href="http://www.comp-sys-bio.org/tiki-index.php?page=SBRML">SBRML</a> |
Ontology: <a href="http://www.biomodels.net/teddy/">TEDDY</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>So, it seems that the idea (wrapping simulations in semantics to create
an automated system for answering questions whose answers are hidden in
simulation results) might not be so unrealistic after all.</p>
