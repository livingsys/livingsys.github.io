  <p>Ad-hoc tasks in bioinformatics can contain such an immense number of operations
and tasks that need to be performed to achieve a certain goal. Often these are
all individually regarded as rather &ldquo;standard&rdquo; or &ldquo;routine&rdquo;. Despite this,
it is quite hard to find an authoritative set of &ldquo;recipes&rdquo; for how to do such
tasks.</p>
<p>Thus I was starting to think that there needs to be a collection of
bioinformatics &ldquo;recipes&rdquo;. A sort of &ldquo;cookbook&rdquo; for common
bioinformatics tasks.</p>
<p>It turns out that there are a number of such resources available though:</p>
<ol>
<li>First there is
<a href="https://www.bioinformatics.recipes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bioinformatics.recipes</a>
 which
is quite much exactly the type of content I was after, except:
<ul>
<li>The only thing I note about this one is it would be great if
these were based on a version control like git, and hosted on a
code hosting platform like GitHub, to make it easier to
collectively both fork, clone and use the included code, but
also contribute fixes or improvements to documentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then, somebody also mentioned <a href="https://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/~hoogeboomhj/mcb/nature_primer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this list of methods primers in the
Nature
journal</a>
.
<ul>
<li>The comment here is perhaps that this is more of high level
information about various methods, which is also great, but not
exactly the same thing as a recipes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finally there is of course BioStars, which is a huge resource of
questions and answers over the last decades.
<ul>
<li>A problem here is mainly that a lot of the questions (and
answers) are quite old, perhaps 10+ years sometimes, which makes
it hard to judge whether an answer is still relevant or not. And
then the selection fo topics is also naturally limited to what
actual questions people have had, which might not cover the
problem area evently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also, there are lists of common best-practice pipelines like the one
at <a href="https://nf-co.re/pipelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NF-core</a>
, which is a hugely useful
resource.
<ul>
<li>But it covers more of high-level analyses, and does not
typically provide pipelines for common smaller tasks like using
blast to cut out a gene from a reference genome or similar.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With this in mind, is it perhaps time to create a bioinformatics recipe
resource based on something like GitHub, where the community can
crowd-source these recipes both in terms of code and documentation?</p>
<p>Or, is there already something like this available?</p>
<p>If not, below are some random ideas about how to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having a common structure and template for documentation.</li>
<li>Having a &ldquo;driver script&rdquo;, like run.sh that is always the same for
each recipe.</li>
<li>One could annotate the input and output files with their file types,
in order to more easily see which recipes are possible to link
together (this could even be presented on an accompanying webpage.
E.g. recipes outputing a VCF (Variant Call Format) file could list
suggestions for recipes to follow up with, based on the ones that
can take VCF-files as input.</li>
</ul>
