<p>Modeling class structures takes some thinking, and when done the
thinking and the drawing and after that starting up using the model,
then you'll spend awful lots of code traversing links in order to
retrieve trivial info in a given object structure. Navigating the same
sometimes complicated link-paths over and over again consumes CPU power
and it also causes much redundant code or expressions accessing the same
navigation paths over and over again. In the Bold For Delphi
Architecture you would also place redundant subscriptions from many
different locations to the same target, subscribing to the same paths
over an over again.</p>
<p>But with Bold you can often directly address unnecessary link
navigation, the redundant navigational
code/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Constraint_Language">OCL</a>-expressions
and at the same time achieve decreasing CPU load by adding derived
associations instead, making a few &quot;dumb&quot; persistent links more useful
and the model more &quot;intelligent&quot;. And furthermore, in doing so
directly in your model your model will at the same time reflect more
specifically which parts of the model is actually used, and how.</p>
<p>An example can show a typical situation where adding many derived links,
extending the model with more useful info, will result in more
efficient, less redundant and more readable code. If we were talking
traditional handcrafting you probably would have thought I was joking,
because we usually don't save us from more problems by adding more
relations between objects...! But I'm not joking, instead you will
actually achieve all the mentioned benefits by adding a few simple lines
(associations) to the model when using Bold.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>A truck vehicle combination can serve us with an example. The example
model will consist of Vehicle units (connected into 'vehicle
combinations', and some <code>Parcels</code> and a <code>Trip</code> object keeping all kinds
of trip info and calculations. With these three basic categories
connected together we will end up writing almost 50% of the code (or
ocl-expressions) for algorithms navigating the basic structure which has
only three persistent links. But such coding is trivial, takes time and
adds no added value to the system.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at a &quot;RIL world representation&quot; of an example
before representing it using an UML class diagram (&quot;RIL&quot; is my
initials):</p>
<p><em>Fig 1: The Vehicle combination below carries <code>Parcels</code>, but only the
front-most <code>VehicleUnit</code> keeps track of <code>Trip</code> info about distances,
events and economic calculations.</em></p>
<p><p class="image">
    <img src="01_truck_combination_with_trip_1_bmp.png" alt="Fig 1: This Vehicle combination carries Parcels, but only the
front-most VehicleUnit keeps track of Trip info about distances, events
and economic
calculations."  class="Fig 1: This Vehicle combination carries Parcels, but only the front-most VehicleUnit keeps track of Trip info about distances, events and economic calculations." />
</p>
</p>
<p>Disregard the artistic aspects of the illustration.</p>
<p>For several reasons, not discussed here, the <code>VehicleUnits</code> shown above
always has a <code>Trip</code> object attached, but only the front-most trip object
is representing the <em>entire vehicle combination</em>. The other trip
objects/calculators are &quot;demobilized&quot; until the <code>trailer</code> (possibly)
is disconnected from the truck, and then the trailer will be a valid
(&quot;front-most&quot;) <code>tripHolder</code> on its own (and thus its Trip object will
be mobilized).</p>
<p>Imagine that you are viewing one of the Vehicle units or one of the
<code>Parcels</code> using a UI. Then you would probably like to know more about
trip related info, like distances traveled, addresses visited, the
visiting order, costs or revenues per km etc (all managed by the trip
object).</p>
<p>Despite the fact that there's only three relations in this model (see
Fig 2. below) you would still have to think twice in order to navigate
correctly trying to find the &quot;calculator&quot; in the front (here
represented by a &quot;<code>Trip</code> class&quot;).</p>
<p>It would be even worse if you wanted to implement some generic logic or
calculations for the <code>VehicleUnits</code>, because you would always have to
make sure that you navigate to the &quot;front-most vehicle unit&quot; (lets
call it the &quot;<code>hauler</code>&quot;) and from the front-most vehicle unit navigate
directly to the trip info (the &quot;calculator&quot;).</p>
<p>In a real application there was so much info embedded in this basic
structure that the three links would be accessed/navigated so many times
that many hundreds of lines of code (and/or OCL expressions) would be
written &quot;here and there and everywhere&quot;. One of the bad things with
that is that if you explicitly traverse every link from one end of the
structure every time you need access to an object or an attribute in the
other end of the structure, you will need to <em>execute</em> the navigation
logic in the CPU every time.</p>
<p>Another bad thing is that your core <em>business logic</em> would &quot;drown&quot; in
the code and expressions dealing with such trivial navigation (lots of
<code>if then else, for i :=</code> and assign checks). And this is where derived
<em>links</em> can help a lot in avoiding a logical mess (derived <em>attributes</em>
would too, of course).</p>
<p><em>Fig 2: A simple class model of the illustration above could look
something like this:</em></p>
<p><p class="image">
    <img src="02_simple_class_model_bmp.png" alt="Fig 2: A simple class model of the illustration above could look
something like
this:"  class="Fig 2: A simple class model of the illustration above could look something like this:" />
</p>
</p>
<p>The navigation problem is more obvious in this class model than in the
&quot;RIL world illustration&quot;.</p>
<p>If I for example select a <code>Parcel</code> in a GUI list and want some trip info
(from the trip object), then as a programmer I couldn't directly tell
the exact navigation path to the &quot;mobilized&quot; trip object, which is the
object holding current valid trip info. Example:</p>
<p>If the parcel was loaded on a <code>trailer</code>, then the expression (from
Parcel) 'vehicleUnit.trip' would return a demobilized trip object! But
if the Parcel was loaded on the <code>hauler</code> it would return the desired
&quot;mobilized&quot; trip object. This complication of things is in itself
reason enough to add a derived link fixing the problem of accessing the
correct trip object directly in the model, so that one as a programmer
never again would have to consider this when coding algorithms that
needs navigating the structure. I would definitely add a link named
<code>effectiveTrip</code>, like so:</p>
<p><em>Fig 3: A link called &quot;<code>effectiveTrip</code>&quot; was added to the model. (I
tend to let blue color represent &quot;persistent&quot; (=&quot;freeze&quot;) and orange
color represent &quot;derived&quot; for links).</em></p>
<p>![Fig 3: A link called &quot;effectiveTrip&quot; was added to the model. (I tend
to let blue color represent &quot;persistent&quot; (=&quot;freeze&quot;) and orange to
represent &quot;derived&quot; for
links).](03_effectivetrip_jpg_bmp.png &ldquo;Fig 3: A link called &ldquo;effectiveTrip&rdquo; was added to the model. (I tend to let blue color represent &ldquo;persistent&rdquo; (=&ldquo;freeze&rdquo;) and orange to represent &ldquo;derived&rdquo; for links).&rdquo;)</p>
<p>This new derived link '<code>effectiveTrip</code> will implement (and thus
&quot;hide&quot;) all the navigation logic needed to reach the front-most trip
object. As I can already now foresee that this link will be accessed
very often from Parcels and in vehicle combinations I would hard code
the derivation logic optimizing the logic for finding the &quot;front-most&quot;
vehicle unit, which involves traversing the <code>trailer</code>/<code>hauler</code> link and
stop when the <code>hauler</code> link is nil (=<code>IsFrontMost</code>), and From there we
can reference the correct trip object directly. This means that we also
realize that accessing the front-most vehicle (the combination hauler)
is very typical and will happen even more often than accessing the trip
object itself! I already know that also the <code>effectiveTrip</code> link can use
such a derived link! So lets add it right away giving it the name
'<code>combinationFirst</code>' (see Fig 4. below).</p>
<p>I selected the name '<code>combinationFirst</code>' because then you immediately
realize the typical in this situation. It's a typical list handling
problem (first, last, etc). Thus you can already now imagine the
usefulness of yet a another derived link which we can call
'<code>combinationLast</code>' and even a third link called
'<code>combinationUnits</code>'!</p>
<p>From a real world example I can assure that these links will be
frequently used and thus the &quot;cost&quot; for evaluating them will be paid
off already the second time you access any one of them!</p>
<p><em>Fig 4: But, doesn't also derived links require CPU in order to be
evaluated, you might ask? The answer is, yes of course, but only once,
if the subscribed items (hauler/trailer connection) don't change. And
this is not very likely, at least not very often, but this very &quot;hot
spot&quot; structure will be used in the logic of many remote places very
often accessing objects cross over, and when doing so the links already
directly references the instances you would want to access. Look at the
&quot;mess&quot; of links below...!:</em></p>
<p>![Fig 4: Doesn't also derived links require CPU in order to be
evaluated...? you might ask. The answer is, yes of course - but only
once - if the subscribed items don't change. And this is not very
likely here, but the very &quot;hot spot&quot; structure here will be used in
many places in the logic accessing objects cross over very often and
when doing so the links already directly references the instances you
want to access. Look at the &quot;mess&quot; of

The answer is, yes of course - but only once - if the subscribed items don&rsquo;t change. And this is not very likely here, but the very &ldquo;hot spot&rdquo; structure here will be used in many places in the logic accessing objects cross over very often and when doing so the links already directly references the instances you want to access. Look at the &ldquo;mess&rdquo; of links&hellip;!:&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Now this is an example of a high performance solution using the model as
the tool for optimization. And in doing so the additional links are at
the same time clarifying/indicating directly in the model the intended
usage of this specific structure.</p>
<p>For those of you who think that I finally got mad I can tell that I
didn't. Instead I increased the speed of the calculations and all the
activities related to this structure in a real world application with
many thousand percents compared to explicitly coding each step of the
entire navigation path each time the combination trip or a specific
<code>VehicleUnit</code> (or attribute in any of them) was accessed!</p>
<p>All kinds of data are stored in this structure and more than 30 derived
attributes for different calculation purposes accesses the structure
back and forth all the time, providing the client user with real-time
calculations of revenues per km and distances, based on distance shares
of totals, based on shares of other shares, based on... etc, etc.</p>
<p>The thing is to, step for step, let one derived link use the other links
as often as possible, then even the need for reevaluating the links
decreases when things changes!</p>
<p>The last statement can be verified very clearly with a separate example
showing how important it is to &quot;REUSE&quot; everything you derive (step for
step) to every higher level (regarding which part of the structure is
more likely to change and which part is more &quot;static&quot;). With &quot;reuse&quot;
I mean &quot;<em>the CPU work already done</em>&quot; for deriving the links (which
then is cached). More on this could be subject for a separate article.</p>
<p>Now lets have a look at some code. Assuming we need to get hold of the
trip object, starting from a <code>Parcel</code>, but we don't know on which
<code>VehicleUnit</code> we are loaded, and therefore we start looking for the trip
using the link <code>effectiveTrip</code> which &quot;hides&quot; the logic determining
which <code>Trip</code> object is &quot;mobilized&quot; (i.e &quot;effective&quot; front-most):</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-pascal" data-lang="pascal">function TParcel.CalculateTrip_Something...: Double;
var
  TripObj : TTrip;
begin
  TripObj := Self.vehicleUnit.effectiveTrip; // that&#39;s it! ...
</code></pre><p>From the Parcel, down to the vehicle platform, and then directly access
the trip. That's easy, and the code is clear. The details about how we
got hold of the correct trip object (hidden in the derived link) does
not, and should not, be mixing up the business logic when traversing and
performing calculations based on this object structure.</p>
<p>In our real world application both <code>VehicleUnits</code> and <code>Parcels</code> have a
common super class (not shown so far). This is because a vehicle can be
loaded on another vehicle, just like any other <code>parcel</code> can be loaded on
a vehicle (or in a batch of Parcels), so the code above is even simpler
in my final generic model where the derived link is &quot;virtual
overridden&quot; in different subclasses. My final code goes like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-pascal" data-lang="pascal">begin
  TripObj := Self.effectiveTrip; // that&#39;s it!
</code></pre><p>The <code>Parcel</code> will find its valid (front-most) <code>Trip</code> using this command
regardless of how complicated the path might be. This change in the
model is shown in fig 5 where a new common super class (for parcels and
vehicles) actually owns the persistent and derived link to the trip
class, and the (abstract) <code>effectiveTrip</code>-link is implemented
(overridden) in the <code>TParcel</code> (knowing to find its way via the vehicles)
and then overridden separately for the <code>VehicleUnit</code> class as shown
below.</p>
<p><em>Fig 5: Here the model is modified to become more generic even allowing
any &quot;planable object&quot; to carry a batch of other planable objects, and
as the model goes more generic, the role names do so too.</em></p>
<p>![Fig 5: Here the model is modified to become more generic even allowing
any &quot;planable object&quot; to carry a batch of other planable objects - and
as the model goes more generic the role names do so
too.](05_model_complete_abstract_bmp.png &ldquo;Fig 5: Here the model is modified to become more generic even allowing any &ldquo;planable object&rdquo; to carry a batch of other planable objects - and as the model goes more generic the role names do so too.&rdquo;)</p>
<p><code>Trip</code> info applies directly for a <code>Parcel</code> too (via
<code>AbstractPlanPortion</code>) because a transport company can plan a parcel to
be delivered with, for instance, an airplane which totals we are not
interested of - but we are still interested in keeping track of any trip
events involved in the actual transportation along with documentation
and transactions attached to the parcel itself etc. But this also means
that when there's need for accessing the &quot;effective&quot; trip object we
also need to perform very complicated checks all over the structure
trying to find out in which context the (correct, &quot;mobilized&quot;) trip
object can be found... Without our derived links hiding (implementing)
all the navigational seeking and trying, this would really make our
calculation logic very complicated only for such a simple thing as just
retrieving some data from the structure. A real nightmare in fact...</p>
<p>This kind of complicating of <em>what should be</em> a simple thing is not very
unique in the programming world. What is unique here though is how it
can be dealt with using Bold technology with its derived links and
subscription mechanisms (and the fact that links are quick and easy to
draw, and they're code generated, and they're automagically
instantiated by the Bold framework when accessed by your code).</p>
<p>Notice again that the <code>Parcel</code> can be a <code>TripHolder</code> itself (Parcel can
even hold batches of other parcels), or if the <code>Parcel</code> is loaded on a
carrier it doesn't know if it's loaded on the carrier which actually
holds the trip info (that is, whether on the hauler or the trailer). We
would really have to do some tricky navigation in this structure! With a
structure like this you can imagine how much redundant coding and how
complicated OCL expressions would be just for accessing information in
the structure. Your core business logic would actually &quot;&quot;drown&quot;&quot; in
navigation logic just for simply retrieving trivial things from the
structure, and the CPU would spend a lot of time finding Your way(s) to
the target objects/data.</p>
<p>Starting from three (3) <em>persistent</em> links (blue) holding the structure
together, we ended up in another five (5) very useful derived links
reducing all the complexity! And the result is that the final
application runs much faster and that the business logic is less
cluttered with trivial navigation code endlessly traversing object
structures.</p>
<p>Before listing the most efficient code for the optimized hard coded
derivations of the links (text based Ocl expressions could also have
been used), I would like to conclude that with these links you can, from
anywhere in the structure, go anywhere, directly, by referencing link
members with names fully clarifying what you intend to access. And all
this will be done in the most efficient way you can come up with using
the Bold architecture.</p>
<p>With &quot;efficient&quot; I mean &quot;always direct access to the desired target
object instance&quot; (except for the first evaluation which in this
particular case happens only once for hundreds of accesses...).</p>
<p>This is only part of the concepts we used consciously to make possible
what was not possible before: using regular, but &quot;clean design&quot;,
modeled and structured object oriented business classes performing high
performance real time (re)calculations of very advanced trip
calculations (not discussed here). On a single CPU (application server)
for multiple clients.</p>
<h3 id="derivation-code-with-comments">Derivation code, with comments</h3>
<p>In the code below I underlined [<em>edit: underline was lost in the new
code format below</em>] all the internal referencing of the derived links
(&quot;efficient cached reuse of already evaluated results&quot;). I also used
local variables thus avoiding the internal &quot;look up&quot; of internal Bold
members more than once (=&gt; avoiding repeated triggering of internal
bold events etc). The efficiency of the entire concept discussed above
and the detailed coding below is verified using ProDelphi profiler (very
high accuracy <strong>(+-3%)</strong> on measuring code performance).</p>
