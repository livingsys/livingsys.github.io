<p>In <a href="https://jcheminf.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-016-0179-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our work on automating machine learning computations in
cheminformatics with scientific workflow
tools</a>
,
we have came to realize something; <em>Dynamic scheduling in scientific
workflow tools is very important and sometimes badly needed.</em></p>
<p>What I mean is that <em>new tasks should be able to be scheduled during the
execution of a workflow, not just in its scheduling phase.</em></p>
<p>What is striking is that far from all workflow tools allow this. Many
tools completely separate the execution into two stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scheduling tasks to be run</li>
<li>Executing those tasks</li>
</ol>
<p>As far as i know this is tha case in common tools such as
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/johanneskoester/snakemake" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snakemake</a>
,
<a href="https://github.com/spotify/luigi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luigi</a>
 and probably
<a href="https://github.com/ssadedin/bpipe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BPipe</a>
 and
<a href="http://www.ruffus.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruffus</a>
, not to mention
<a href="http://galaxyproject.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galaxy</a>
 and
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/ccgmurdoch/yabi/wiki/Home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yabi</a>
 (Tool authors,
correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong!).</p>
<p>The case where we really have needed this was for running machine
learning algorithms on data sets of various data set sizes. To gain
optimal models, we have been first first optimizing the cost parameter
to our training step by running a parameter-sweep over a set of cost
values. The performance of training with different cost values is then
evaluated and an optimal cost is chosen. And now comes the interesting
part: We want to schedule a defined workflow with this newly selected
cost value. This is not easily done in
<a href="https://github.com/spotify/luigi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luigi</a>
 even with our
<a href="https://github.com/samuell/sciluigi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SciLuigi</a>
 extension since Luigi
separates scheduling and execution, but also since parameters to
workflows must be initiated at scheduling time. Thus we can not use a
value resulting from calculations within a workflow run to start the
next task, inside the same workflow.</p>
<p>Of course we found a work-around for this: We created a task that takes
the chosen cost value and executes a shell command to start a separate
python process with that other part of the workflow. It works, but it
results in various problems. For one, things are not closely integrated,
we get extra overhead and the separate workflow instance will create
separate logging, audit files etc. Thus, this is something I would like
to see in the next workflow system we use: Ability to schedule new tasks
continuously from during execution of a workflow.</p>
<p>Interestingly this is a feature that comes for free in tools that adhere
to the dataflow paradigm. In most dataflow tools you have independently
running processes that receive messages with input data that
continuously schedule new tasks as they receive messages until the
system hands them a message telling them to shut down. &ldquo;Dynamic
scheduling&rdquo; is really how dataflow systems work in other words, which I
find interesting. I think the dataflow system
<a href="http://nextflow.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nextflow</a>
 works like this. And so does my <a href="http://scipipe.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">little
experiment in a pure Go workflow library</a>
, which I
started hacking on out of frustration with some other tools a long time
ago, although that one still lacks most other popular features ;)</p>
<p>I just had not realized how important this feature could be, for very
common use cases.</p>
