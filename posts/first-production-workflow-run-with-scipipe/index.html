  <p>Today marked the day when we ran the very first production workflow with
<a href="http://scipipe.org">SciPipe</a>, the <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>-based
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_workflow_system">scientific workflow
tool</a> we've
been working on over the last couple of years. Yay! :)</p>
<p>This is how it looked (no fancy GUI or such yet, sorry):</p>
<p><p class="image">

</p>
</p>
<p>The first result we got in this very very first job was a list of counts
of ligands (chemical compounds) in the <a href="https://jcheminf.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-017-0203-5">ExcapeDB
dataset</a>
(<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/173258">download here</a>) interacting with the
44 protein/gene targets <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrd3845">identified by Bowes et
al</a> as a good baseline set for
identifying hazardous side-effects effects in the body (that is, any
chemical compounds binding these proteins, will never become an approved
drug).</p>
<p>The resulting data still needs some closer review (some gene names were
not available in the dataset etc), so right now just including a preview
screenshot:</p>

<p>Fun! :) This is only the very beginning of this project, for which
scipipe was actually designed from the start. So a lot more workflow
coding is going to happen. There are also still many plans for polish
and improvements amassed in the <a href="https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe/issues">issue
queue</a>, but it is fun to be
able to say that it has now been solving real world problems.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I found it enlightening to note the shift in
perspective happening when starting to use an API to solve real world
problems versus sitting and over-obsessing over small details based on
imaginary use cases. Suddenly a very clear prioritization of what to
really fix, and what to really not, emerged :)</p>
<h2 id="why-not-continue-with-sciluigi">Why not continue with SciLuigi?</h2>
<p>Previous <a href="https://jcheminf.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-016-0151-5">data analysis
projects</a>
have been done using Spotify's
<a href="https://github.com/spotify/luigi">Luigi</a> in combination with our helper
tool <a href="https://github.com/pharmbio/sciluigi">SciLuigi</a> which we released
a <a href="http://jcheminf.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-016-0179-6">pretty detailed
paper</a>
about, so let me add a few words about why we developed this new tool.</p>
<p>We had some success with SciLuigi and were pretty happy with it, until
some of the problems with how Python is implemented started to show up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, since Python is an untyped, interpreted language we
sometimes had HPC cluster jobs failing seven days into a seven day
HPC job, because of a simple KeyError.</li>
<li>Secondly, our way of keeping track of HPC jobs with one Luigi worker
per job already when queuing it up in the SLURM resource manager
with the blocking salloc command, created some problems. The fact
that Luigi creates separate processes for each worker, which
communicate with the central Luigi scheduler via HTTP over the
network lead to robustness problems over around 64 workers, with
HTTP-timeouts and other similar glitches.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, I'm very excited we are now running our Go-based tool. While it
takes a lot of inspiration from both Luigi and SciLuigi, such as
Luigi's very powerful file naming strategy and the named port ideas we
developed in SciLuigi, it also solves both of the mentioned problems
above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, Go is a typed and compiled language that will almost always
warn about simple errors already at the compilation step.</li>
<li>Go does not need spawn separate processes for keeping track of
external commands, only threads, and communication and coordination
is done completely inside the Go binary.</li>
</ul>
<p>SciPipe further adds even more improvements such as full dataflow
behaviour, meaning that construction of the tree of concrete tasks to
execute doesn't need to be done before leaving over to the execution
engine. Instead, tasks are scheduled on-the-fly while the engine is
running, based on data fed into processes. This will greatly simplify
some workflow constructs we had problems with in SciLuigi.</p>
<p>One such example is when there is a parameter to be used in a component
further down in the workflow, where this parameter is itself a result of
a calculation in some upstream component. Since Luigi strictly separates
scheduling and execution it was not possible to handle this in
Luigi/SciLuigi without having the main workflow to fire up new Luigi
instances using the parameters obtained in the first workflow. The
latter case is exactly what we ended up doing with SciLuigi, but
resulted in multiple log files and many other issues that made running
it quite a mess. This, among many other things should now be a breeze to
implement with SciPipe because of its
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow">DataFlow</a> + <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based%20programming">Flow-Based
Programming</a>
approach.</p>
<h2 id="for-something-more-stable---consider-nextflow">For something more stable - consider NextFlow</h2>
<p>Note though: For those who'd prefer a more mature, stable, and
supported solution with a bigger established community, note that
<a href="https://www.nextflow.io/">NextFlow</a> (see also <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3820">the
paper</a>) has the same benefits in
this case, as also being based on dataflow. Let me thus say a few words
of why we are still developing our own solution.</p>
<p>The reason is primarily because find the named ports concept in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based%20programming">Flow-based
Programming</a> to
be crucial for our vision of creating a library of re-usable workflow
components for our use cases. In concrete terms, this means that <a href="http://bionics.it/posts/fbp-data-flow-syntax#comment-2140898697">inputs
and outputs are defined as fields (&quot;ports&quot;) bound to
components</a>,
rather than being unbound variables shared between components in the
workflow scope, as is the case in NextFlow. We think this is important
in order to make re-usable components self-contained and
self-documentary, and also helps with things like autocompletion (type
&quot;componentname.&lt;tab&gt;&quot; and you will get a list of the available
ports). <a href="http://bionics.it/posts/fbp-data-flow-syntax#comment-2141038801">Nextflow takes a slightly different view
here</a>
and instead <a href="http://bionics.it/posts/fbp-data-flow-syntax#comment-2141038801">treats the commandline program being integrated, as the
re-usable
component</a>,
which seems to be a reasonable assumption in the Genomics field which it
is focused on.</p>
<p>What is perhaps a more interesting note here though, is that in all the
very fruitful discussions I've had with NextFlow creator <a href="https://twitter.com/PaoloDiTommaso">Paolo Di
Tommaso</a> we both whole-heartedly
agree about the power and ease of use of the dataflow paradigm.
Hopefully we can eventually get support for some of the dataflow
specialities in the <a href="http://commonwl.org">Common Workflow Language</a>.
Let's continue to explore how the process of writing workflows can be
made even more fluent, flexible and fun. :)</p>
