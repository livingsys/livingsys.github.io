<p><em><strong>TL;DR: We wrote a post on gopherdata.io, about the growing ecosystem
of Go-based workflow tools in bioinformatics. <a href="https://gopherdata.io/post/more_go_based_workflow_tools_in_bioinformatics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go read it
here</a>
</strong></em></p>
<p>It is interesting to note how Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go programming
language</a>
 seems to increase in popularity in
bioinformatics.</p>
<p>Just to give a sample of some of the Go based bioinformatics tools I&rsquo;ve
stumbled upon, there is since a few years back, the <a href="https://github.com/biogo/biogo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biogo
library</a>
, providing common functionality
for bioinformatics tasks. It was recently reviewed in two great blog
posts (<a href="https://medium.com/@boti_ka/a-gentle-introduction-to-b%C3%ADogo-part-i-65dbd40e31d4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part
I</a>
,
<a href="https://medium.com/@boti_ka/a-gentle-introduction-to-b%C3%ADogo-part-ii-1f0df1cf72f0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part
II</a>
).
Further, Brent Pedersen also wrote a little collection of Go based
bioinfo tools, compiled down into a single static binary, called
<a href="https://github.com/brentp/goleft" target="_blank" rel="noopener">goleft</a>
, and finally, I there is the
<a href="https://github.com/exascience/elprep" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elprep tool</a>
, used to prepare
.sam/.bam/.cram files for variant calling, which was published in a
<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0132868" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PLoS one
paper</a>
.
Just a few examples.</p>
<p>As being a lot into workflows, and workflows in Go in particular, with
my work on <a href="http://scipipe.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SciPipe</a>
, it is particularly interesting
to see the ecosystem of Go-based workflow tools for bioinformatics,
growing. At <a href="https://pharmb.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pharmb.io</a>
, we are already
experimenting with the more full-blown (compared to SciPipe) framework
<a href="http://pachyderm.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pachyderm</a>
, and I have seen a Go based framework
named <a href="https://github.com/MG-RAST/AWE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWE</a>
 as well. Now, the other
week, super-well-funded life science startup <a href="http://grail.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grail
Inc</a>
. released the tool they are using to run
bioinformatics analyses on the cloud, named
<a href="https://github.com/grailbio/reflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reflow</a>
.</p>
<p>This is all very exciting for the Go-in-datascience (aka #gopherdata)
and Go-in-bioinformatics communities. But it also felt like it might be
time to step back and do a little overview of the growing workflow tool
landscape, now that the options start to be more than just one or two
main ones. So, this is what we - together with <a href="https://twitter.com/dwhitena" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel
Whitenack</a>
 of Pachyderm, and my colleague
<a href="https://pharmb.io/people/jon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jon Ander Novella</a>
, decided to do. Find
