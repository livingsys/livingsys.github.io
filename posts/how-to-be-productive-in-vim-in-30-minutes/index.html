<p>I had heard a lot of people say vim is very hard to learn, and got the
impression that it will take a great investment to switch to using it.</p>
<p>While I have came to understand that they are right in that there is a
lot of things to invest in to get really great at using vim, that will
really pay back, I have also found out one thing that I see almost
no-one mentioning:</p>
<p><em><strong>You can be as productive in vim as in a normal text-editor, in 30
minutes.</strong></em></p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the secret sauce behind this? What will I sell you to make
this happen? Nothing! The answer is shipped with vim, and if you have
vim installed on a unix-like system, then follow these steps, and
you&rsquo;re done:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open up a terminal</li>
<li>Type <code>vimtutor</code></li>
<li>Press enter</li>
<li>Follow the tutorial carefully to the end</li>
<li>Try to remember at least the 10-15 first commands</li>
<li>Type <code>:q&lt;Enter&gt;</code> to quit</li>
<li>Done!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>vimtutor</strong>, the secret sauce in all of this, is an interactive
commandline tutorial, that will guide you through the ~15-20 commands
that you need to be productive in vim, and let you practice them a few
times. I personally found I was good with remembering the 10-15 first of
these. But the best part: You will be done with the guide in a mere 30
minutes or so. And what is also nice, is that if you actually practiced
the commands while going through it, you will actually be able to
remember some 10-15 commands, even after 30 minutes.</p>
<p>I find that vimtutor is so effective, that I can&rsquo;t understand why it is
not more well-known. E.g. I myself found out about it years after my
first failed attempts to learn vim.</p>

than <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Practical Vim</a>
 , from
the pragmatic programmer bookshelf.</li>
<li><strong>EDIT:</strong> I also got a comment from a friend who found <a href="http://vim-adventures.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vim
Adventures</a>
 very effective.*</li>
