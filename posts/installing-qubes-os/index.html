  <h1>Installing Qubes OS</h1>

  
  
  <time datetime="2021-12-29T06:59:00&#43;01:00">December 29, 2021</time>

  <p>I just switched to <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qubes OS</a>
 as operating
system on my main work laptop (a Dell Latitude). Or in fact, one of the
reasons was to be able to combine work and private hobby coding
projects, that's increasinbly been happening on the same machine.
Anyways, these are my experiences and notes, as a way to document
caveats and quirks in case I need to do this again, while possibly also
being of use for others.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-qubes-os">What is Qubes OS?</h3>
<p>Qubes OS is an operating system that tries to provide &quot;reasonable
security&quot; to users by means of compartmenalization. By using
virtualization technologies, it makes it easy to create multiple virtual
machines that co-exist on the same computer. Now, couldn't you just use
multiple VirtualBoxes, you might ask? Well, Qubes makes the whole
process a lot more smooth and integrated than that. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can seamlessly have windows from multiple VMs open at the same
time, and tile them as you want (only they will have a dedicated
color in the outer frame to make sure you don't mix them up).</li>
<li>Multiple so called &quot;App VMs&quot; can share the same &quot;Base VM&quot; where
you do all the installation of software etc, which means it is a lot
less work to keep them updated with the latest packages.</li>
<li>Routing of various appliances such as webcams, mics, USB-keybards
and the like is done manually (though easily) for each App VM, so as
not to accidentally open up attack vectors ... all for increased
compartmentalization and thus security.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are still not convinced, you might be when you learn that Qubes
is <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/781493632293605376" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommeded by Edward
Snowden</a>
 :)</p>
<h3 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h3>
<p>The first thing I did was to try and install Qubes in a virtual machine
in Virtual Box. It did warn a lot about various hardware drivers though:</p>
<p><p class="image">
    <img src="qubesmissingfeatures.jpg" alt="The message as text: Unsupported Hardware Detected - This hardware
lacks features required by Qubes OS: Missing features: HVM/VT-x/AMD-V,
IOMMU/VT-d/AMD-Vi, HAP/SLAT/EPT/RVI, Interrupt Remapping. Without these
features, Qubes OS will not function normally. It is recommended that
only developers and power users proceed with the installation. Fore more
information on supported hardware, please refer to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/system-requirements/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/system-requirements/&lt;/a&gt;
"  />
</p>
</p>
<p>Thus, trying out Qubes fully in VirtualBox didn't seem like an option.
Based on this info, you should also probably go though your BIOS
settings and make sure that these settings are turned on if you plan on
installing it &quot;on metal&quot;. In particular VT-x use to be possible to
turn on/off in BIOS I think.</p>
<p>I still managed to install the base system in virtualbox though, but I
reckon the actual boxes, or &quot;qubes&quot; would not work that well:</p>
<p><p class="image">

</p>
</p>
<h3 id="creating-an-installable-media">Creating an installable media</h3>
<p>Anyways, on to the installation on metal. I first tried creating a USB
stick with the Qubes OS .iso file using the popular UNetBootin software
in Ubuntu, but that did not work. There was a warning about that during
the installation. Thus, you need to instead use the dd tool to copy the
image to the USB stick. BE WARNED though that this will completely erase
all other data on the USB stick, so make sure to move away any data you
might have there first!</p>
<p>The command is something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>dd bs=4M <span style="color:#00f">if</span>=/path/to/qubesos.iso of=/dev/sdb
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>WARNING: Check first that sdb is actually your usb drive! This can be
done using a software such as gparted.</p>
<h3 id="no-bootable-device-found">&quot;No bootable device found&quot;</h3>
<p>After booting up the computer and installing Qubes OS through the
graphical installer, with most settings set to default (a pretty easy
and painless process), when restarting the computer, I got the message:</p>
<p>No bootable device found.</p>
<p>Not so fun. On the other hand, it turned out to be pretty easily fixed,
by booting up the computer with a Live Ubuntu USB stick, and fixing the
file paths in the UEFI partition according to <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/uefi-troubleshooting/#boot-device-not-recognized-after-installing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this advice in the Qubes
Docs</a>
.
Copying the instructions here for backup:</p>
<p>Some firmware will not recognize the default Qubes EFI configuration. As
such, it will have to be manually edited to be bootable. This will need
to be done after every kernel and Xen update to ensure you use the most
recently installed versions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Copy the <code>/boot/efi/EFI/qubes/</code>{.language-plaintext
.highlighter-rouge} directory to
<code>/boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/</code>{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge} (the
contents of <code>/boot/efi/EFI/BOOT</code>{.language-plaintext
.highlighter-rouge} should be identical to
<code>/boot/efi/EFI/qubes</code>{.language-plaintext .highlighter-rouge}
besides what is described in steps 2 and 3):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>cp -r /boot/efi/EFI/qubes/. /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT
</span></span></code></pre></div></li>
<li>
<p>Rename <code>/boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/xen.cfg</code>{.language-plaintext
.highlighter-rouge} to
<code>/boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.cfg</code>{.language-plaintext
.highlighter-rouge}:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>mv /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/xen.cfg /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.cfg
</span></span></code></pre></div></li>
<li>
<p>Copy <code>/boot/efi/EFI/qubes/xen-*.efi</code>{.language-plaintext
.highlighter-rouge} to
<code>/boot/efi/EFI/qubes/xen.efi</code>{.language-plaintext
.highlighter-rouge} and
<code>/boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi</code>{.language-plaintext
.highlighter-rouge}. For example, with Xen 4.8.3 (you may need to
confirm file overwrite):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>cp /boot/efi/EFI/qubes/xen-4.8.3.efi /boot/efi/EFI/qubes/xen.efi
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>cp /boot/efi/EFI/qubes/xen-4.8.3.efi /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi
</span></span></code></pre></div></li>
</ol>
<p>It works!</p>
<h3 id="some-caveats">Some caveats</h3>
<p>After doing this and rebooting, it just works! What followed is just the
normal setting up of things in Qubes OS. There were some things I
learned that were not obvious from the start, and which can be useful to
know though:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can not use my USB-connected keyboard to control the main
interface (a.k.a. &quot;dom0&quot;). What I can do though, is to manually
connect the keyboard to individual boxes by clicking the status icon
in the top right corner (the one that looks like a gzip-icon). This
is apparently due to some security concerns. The USB mouse works
everywhere though. For keyboard use in dom0, I have to rely on the
laptop's built-in keyboard.</li>
<li>For switching the USB keyboard between qubes I require two clicks:
One to disconnect it from the current qube, and one to connect it to
the new one. This means I'll want to somehow minimize the number of
qubes I need to switch between often. It would be nice to at least
require just one click, or even better, be able to switch to another
qube by e.g. right-clicking on a window belonging to that qube and
selecting e.g. &quot;connect keyboard to this qube&quot;.</li>
<li>Software installations have to be done in the &quot;base qubes&quot;, such
as Fedora 32, Debian 10/11 etc. Software installations in &quot;app
VMs&quot; won't persist after rebooting. (For content in the home
folder this seems to be reversed though: Stuff in the home folder is
kept in the app VMs, but not in the base VMs).</li>
<li>To have the newly installed software appear in an app VM after
installing in the base VM, one will need to turn off both of them,
and then start the App VM again.</li>
<li>I did not manage to change font sizes in VMs if they were based on
the Debian 10 or Debian 11 base images. I have <a href="https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/dark-mode-in-debian-10-vm/3855/17?u=shl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written about it in
the forum
here</a>

(I DID manage to activate dark mode, as my forum message states).
Thus, I have had to resort to using Fedora 32 as base image rather
than Debian 11, which is a bit disappointing, as I'm much more used
to Debian/Ubuntu-based distros.</li>
<li>The base system is based on XFCE, and so is highly customizable. I
was able to adjust it to be much more good-looking than the default
config, in my opinion, using the &quot;Adwaita-dark&quot; theme, and some
smaller fonts (More specifically: &quot;Liberation Sans 10&quot; for normal
application content, set in the &quot;appearance&quot; app, and &quot;Sans 10&quot;
for window titles and the like, set in the &quot;Window manager&quot; app).</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from these caveats though, everything works surprisingly well! The
whole concept and implementation is very very impressive!</p>

<ul>
<li>I found Qubes founder <a href="https://blog.invisiblethings.org/2011/03/13/partitioning-my-digital-life-into.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joanna Rutkowska's blog about how she set up
the OS for her own
workflow</a>

very useful in getting to think about how to best use the features
for your own use cases. I have personally went with a much simpler
set up for the time being, but the post helped me to clarify my own
plan for this.</li>
