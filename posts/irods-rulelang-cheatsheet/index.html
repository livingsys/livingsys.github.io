<a href="http://irods.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iRODS</a>
,
the &quot;integrated rule oriented data system&quot; is a super cool system for
managing datasets consisting of files, from smallish ones, to really
large ones counted in petabytes, and possibly spanning multiple
continents.</p>
<p>There's a lot to be said about iRODS (up for another blog post) but the
one most interesting feature, in my opinion, is the <em>rule language</em>,
which allows to define custom rules and policies for how data should be
handled, totally automatically, depending on a lot of factors. For
example &quot;if data if untouched for three months, transparently migrate
it from fast disk storage to archival tape storage&quot;, etc etc.</p>
<p>The rule language is - as the name suggests - a whole language on its
own though, and can be a bit daunting to quickly learn or get a good
overview of. There is <a href="https://wiki.irods.org/index.php/Changes_and_Improvements_to_the_Rule_Language_and_the_Rule_Engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some
documentation</a>

on the wiki, but it is not exactly eaily overviewed (great work is going
on to improve the situation).</p>
<p>Thus, in a project I recently participated, with the aim to set up a
data federation for proteomics data between <a href="http://irods.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BILS Bioinformatics
Infrastructure</a>
 in Sweden and the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European
Bioinformatics Institute</a>
 in the UK (<a href="https://github.com/BILS/irods-b2safe-vagrant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documented
as a runnable vagrant
box</a>
), I realized I had to
do something about the situation. So, I created a <a href="https://github.com/samuell/irods-rulelang-cheatsheet#readme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2-page A4 cheat
sheet</a>
. It
is <a href="https://github.com/samuell/irods-rulelang-cheatsheet#readme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available on
github</a>
,
and I include images below as well, as a preview:</p>
<p><strong>Page 1</strong></p>

</p>
</p>
<p><strong>Page 2</strong></p>
<p><p class="image">
    <img src="irodsrules_p2.png" alt=""  />
</p>
</p>
<p>The raw format of the cheat sheet is HTML with inline CSS, as I could
not find anything else that would give me the right control over fonts,
formatting and coloring (probably possible with LaTeX, but it seemed to
require too much work).</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy, and make sure to fork and improve if you see
possibilities for that!</p>
