  <p><em>This post is <a href="https://medium.com/@saml/launching-kubernetes-jobs-from-the-go-api-notes-from-a-beginner-2b34fbc502c0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also published on

</em></p>
<p>My current work at <a href="http://pharmb.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pharmb.io</a>
 entails adding
<a href="http://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kubernetes</a>
 support to my light-weight Go-based
scientific workflow engine,
<a href="https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scipipe</a>
 (kubernetes, or <em>k8s</em> for
short, is Google&rsquo;s open source project for orchestrating container based
compute clusters), which should take scipipe from a simple &ldquo;run it on
your laptop&rdquo; workflow system with HPC support still in the work, to
something that can power scientific workflows on any set of networked
computers that can run kubernetes, which is quite a few (AWS, GCE,
Azure, your Raspberry Phi cluster etc etc).</p>
<p>As scipipe is itself written in Go it seemed natural to go with the
officially supported <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go" target="_blank" rel="noopener">programmatic Go
API</a>
 to kubernetes. This turned
out to be less than a smooth ride though, at least to start with. Thus,
I thought it worthwhile to jot down a few of the observations I did as a
complete newcomer to kubernetes and this style of writing programming
APIs, in the hopes that it might help some other newcomer, and maybe
give kubernetes developers a few hints on where to focus efforts in
documenting the API.</p>
<h3 id="documentation---or-not">Documentation &mdash; or not</h3>
<p>The first thing I noted, when looking for documentation for the
programmatic access to the API, is that there wasn&rsquo;t much, except for <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/accessing-the-cluster/#programmatic-access-to-the-api" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a
minimal section in the user
guide</a>
,
and <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go#how-to-use-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two possibly even more minimal code
examples</a>
. None
of those showed specifically how to work with the (batch) jobs API
though, so I was still left in the dark in that regard.</p>
<p>I also, somewhere down the line found the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/blob/master/pkg/apis/batch/types.go" target="_blank" rel="noopener">code file where most of the
API types for the batch job API were
defined</a>
.
But since the types were all spread out, and depending on each other in
very complex ways, without a clear starting point, it was not too
helpful for a newcomer.</p>
<p>A few guiding words on the principles, or how to find stuff, would have
helped tons here.</p>
<p>Well, finally, by surfing around lots and lots, I stumbled upon the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">API
conventions
document</a>
,
which in fact gives a few hints about the thinking behind the API
structure. That helped to get some kind of idea of the thinking behind
the API (link this document more prominently maybe?).</p>
<p>And, what finally made me get forward, was when I found an example of a
3rd party library that created kubernetes jobs, <a href="https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/blob/805e63/src/server/pps/server/api_server.go#L480" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the
code</a>

of <a href="http://pachyderm.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pachyderm</a>
(Pachyderm is cool cool stuff, but
more on that in another post perhaps).</p>
<p>I was still heavy scared by stuff like these import statements:</p>
<p><p class="image">
    <img src="selection_117.png" alt=""  />
</p>
</p>
<p>Heeya! &hellip; I mean, which one do I even start with, to look for &hellip; some
kind of starting point or something?</p>
<h3 id="when-it-clicked">When it clicked</h3>
<p>Well, following the pachyderm code example, and working backwards,
jumping to the definitions of each type or function returning a type, a
pattern finally started to emerge.</p>
<p>So, it turns out, that complex struct types such as Job, JobSpec,
ImageSpec etc, are simply just complex structures of structs of structs
of structs &hellip; which could essentially be defined as a large JSON
structure, but by being a structure of hierarchical types, one gets
automatic type safety already at the compilation level &hellip; and also it
is not that hard to find the right type to use for a field: The type of
the value that will populate a field, is typically named the same as the
field name itself, so one can typically just assume that, and start
typing <code>SomeFieldName: api.SomeFieldType...</code> in a Go editor with good
autocompletion support (such as <a href="http://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VSCode</a>

with Luke Hoban&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great great Go
plugin</a>
, or Vim with Fatih&rsquo;s
<a href="https://github.com/fatih/vim-go" target="_blank" rel="noopener">awesome Vim-Go plugin</a>
), and you will
find it (see <a href="https://github.com/samuell/k8s-experiments/blob/0ada4a53c9e19d29f129960b5d278afe99cdb67f/k8sexp.go#L43-L90" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my working code
example</a>

mentioned at the very end of the post, for a look at how this looks in
reality).</p>
<p>Finally, the<code>unversioned</code> and <code>batch</code> API files seems to be used only in
a few special cases, so the main <code>api</code> endpoint
(k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/api) seems to be where to look most of the time.</p>
<p>All in all, after I get the idea behind this, with the hierarchy of
typed structs. It all kind of starts to make sense, as you get the
safety and all. And most importantly, I finally managed to <a href="https://github.com/samuell/k8s-experiments/blob/0ada4a53c9e19d29f129960b5d278afe99cdb67f/k8sexp.go#L43-L90" target="_blank" rel="noopener">start my
first kubernetes job via the Go
API</a>
!
:) Now it just remains to <a href="https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe/issues/32" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get it integrated in
scipipe</a>
 soon enough.</p>

<li><strong>UPDATE:</strong> There we go, two working examples implemented (Tested only on
MiniKube so far though): A <a href="https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe/blob/feature/k8s-support/examples/k8s_minimal/k8s_minimal.go" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minimal
example</a>

(<a href="https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe/blob/feature/k8s-support/examples/k8s_minimal/k8s_jobspec.yml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accompanying jobspec
file</a>
),
and <a href="https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe/blob/feature/k8s-support/examples/k8s_openms/k8s_openms.go" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one running the OpenMS metabolomics
software</a>

(<a href="https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe/blob/feature/k8s-support/examples/k8s_openms/k8s_jobspec.yml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jobspec
