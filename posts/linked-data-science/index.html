<p>Historically, something of a divide has developed between the metadata
rich datasets and approaches in the world of Semantic
Web/Ontologies/Linked Data, versus in the Big Data field in particular,
which has been at least initially mostly focused on large unstructured
datasets.</p>
<p>Even today&rsquo;s focus on data science and development of predictive models
using technologies like deep learning, is to a large extent focusing on
data sets with a relatively non-complex structure (2D-images), and not
so much on merging knowledge stored in opaque deep learning models with
explicit knowledge stored in ontologies and knowledge bases of different
kinds.</p>
<p>In order to ripe the fruits of the recent boom in developments of
machine learning technologies also in other fields with much more
complex and rich data but without large numbers of very similar
examples, it seems we will need to link Big Data science with <em>smart</em>
data science. That is, state-of-the-art methods and tools from data
science, Big Data and machine learning, with semantic data modelling,
such as with technologies in Semantic Web, Linked Data and Logic
Programming.</p>
<p>Personally, I think it is particularly the <em>reasoning</em> capabilities
around linked/semantic data, that need further development. Based on
<a href="http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:398839" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very positive experience of using SWI-Prolog to implement lookup
methods in
cheminformatics</a>
,
I am personally a strong believer in using logic programming approaches
as a very practical approach to implement extremely intelligent
reasoning systems that can still be easy to understand.</p>
<p>At the <a href="https://lankadedata.se/LDSV/2018/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linked Data Sweden
symposium</a>
 in Uppsala in
April 2018, <a href="http://bionics.it/posts/semantic-web-data-science-my-talk-at-linked-data-sweden-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I presented these
ideas</a>

and suggested that <a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SWI-Prolog</a>
 in
particular might be a suitable integration platform for what we could
call <em>linked data science</em>, or <em>linked big data science</em> (<a href="http://bionics.it/posts/semantic-web-data-science-my-talk-at-linked-data-sweden-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slides and
video for the presentation
here</a>
).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SWI-Prolog</a>
 is a mature, well-maintained
and high quality open source Prolog implementation, with an extensive
set of libraries, including top-class support for interacting with RDF
datasets and SPARQL endpoints. The main drawback of SWI-Prolog for large
datasets has been that it has lacked a generic disk based storage
solution. Instead, full datasets have had to be loaded into memory
before doing complex queries upon them. A recently developed plugin for
the <a href="http://rdfhdt.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RDF-HDT</a>
 format seems to provide an interesting
way to solve this problem, at least for read-only access to large
datasets. Since RDF-HDT is an indexed format, it allows doing queries
against its data by only loading the index into memory, not the full
dataset. Since SWI-Prolog also can fluently incorporate SPARQL queries
into logic programming queries, this also provides an ability to
interact with many large-scale datasets such as
<a href="https://www.wikidata.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikidata</a>
, not to mention <a href="https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semantic
MediaWiki</a>
s with the
<a href="https://github.com/rdfio/RDFIO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RDFIO</a>
 extension that we developed in
paper III. In the release notes for RDFIO <a href="https://github.com/rdfio/RDFIO/releases/tag/v3.0.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">version
3.0.1</a>
 and
<a href="https://github.com/rdfio/RDFIO/releases/tag/v3.0.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3.0.2</a>
 we provided
screenshots demonstrating the ability to query Semantic MediaWiki data
via the SPARQL endpoint provided with RDFIO, from SWI-Prolog. SWI-Prolog
also provides a web based notebook quite similar to Jupyter notebooks
called <a href="https://swish.swi-prolog.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SWISH</a>
, allowing to use the
notebook paradigm for interactive data exploration.</p>
<p>The described vision is illustrated in the figure above, which
illustrates how SWI-Prolog can be used as an interactive integration
workbench for accessing and fluently integrating knowledge from external
linked datasets. Data sources that can be accessed include SPARQL
endpoints (e.g. RDFIO powered Semantic MediaWikis) or RDF-HDT data
files. These can be fluently integrated into the logic programming
environment, via rules or queries, which can be used as building blocks
for further rules or queries. While the SWISH screenshot is here used
only for illustration purposes and shows toy example code, the terminal
screenshot in the background is a real-world one, showing how SWI-Prolog
is interacting with an external SPARQL endpoint of an RDFIO-powered
Semantic MediaWiki.</p>
