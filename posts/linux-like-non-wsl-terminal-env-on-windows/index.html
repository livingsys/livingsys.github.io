  <p>I was looking for was a no-fuss, lightweight, robust and as simple as
possible solution to running my normal Bash-based workflow inside the
main Windows filesystem, interacting with the Windows world. Turns out
there are some solutions. Read on for more info on that.</p>
<h2 id="windows-subsystem-for-linux-too-heavy">Windows Subsystem for Linux too heavy</h2>
<p>First, I must mention the impressive work by Microsoft on the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about">Windows
Subsystem for Linux (aka.
WSL)</a>, which more or
less lets you run an almost full-blown distribution of popular Linux
distros like Ubuntu and Fedora. WSL is awesome, but also kind of heavy,
easily taking something closer to an hour to install. It also has some
odd behaviours like opening files in Windows from WSL will give you
troubles with line endings (as you might know Windows uses <code>\r\n</code> for
line endings while Linux uses just <code>\n</code>). Finally, the default bash
terminal for WSL did not even have zoomable text. All in all, this made
it clear that this is not the light-weight simple solution I was looking
for. WSL is awesome, but too heavy that I will be comfortable to quickly
install it on any Windows machine I need to spend time working on.</p>
<h2 id="enter-git-bash-and-msys2">Enter Git-Bash and MSYS2</h2>
<p>Thus, I continued my search. I found Git-Bash, which is part of the <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git
package for Windows</a>. It provides a
simple bash environment with git pre-installed and configured, and works
extremely well for simple tasks.</p>
<p>The main drawback I found with Git-Bash was that it does not contain or
allow an easy route to install my favorite terminal multiplexer / window
manager: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux">tmux</a>. <a href="https://blog.pjsen.eu/?p=440">One nice blog
post</a> mentioned the system that Git-Bash
builds upon, and that it sports a package manager which can install a
lot more software: MSYS2. Long story short: I tried MSYS2, and now I'm
(figuratively) in love. With a few (fixable) caveats I now can run
pretty much my full command-line bash+tmux+vim+git(+etc etc) workflow
from Xubuntu, IN WINDOWS, right inside the Windows filesystem ... and
things just work!</p>
<p>So, for my own and others' documentation, I below provide documentation
of the procedure I have so far followed to enable a comfortable very
Linux-like bash environment in Windows.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-set-up-a-nice-environment-based-on-msys2">How to set up a nice environment based on MSYS2</h2>
<ul>
<li>Install MSYS2 by following the instructions
<a href="https://www.msys2.org/">here</a>.</li>
<li>Start MSYS2 from the start menu in Windows.</li>
<li>Run upgrades of packages with the pacman packager:
<ul>
<li><strong><code>pacman -Syu</code></strong></li>
<li>Hard restart terminal</li>
<li><strong><code>pacman -Su</code></strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Install packages with <strong><code>pacman -S &lt;package&gt;</code></strong>
<ul>
<li>Some packages I installed:
<ul>
<li>vim</li>
<li>git</li>
<li>tig (The awesome text-mode interface to git)</li>
<li>tmux</li>
<li>man-db (for manual pages)</li>
<li>cgdb</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Install the python 3.7 Windows package from python.org</li>
<li>Configure git to check out files with Windows style line endings,
but check in with Linux style ditto:
<ul>
<li><strong><code>git config --global core.autocrlf true</code></strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make python scripts properly print output continuously:
<ul>
<li><strong><code>alias python='winpty python.exe'</code></strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For Python development,</li>
<li>Install the <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey package manager</a>,
for installing many open source programs via the commandline, by
following <a href="https://chocolatey.org/install">these instructions.</a></li>
<li>If you run Windows in VirtualBox, make sure to enable bidirectional
clipboard in VirtualBox, by right clicking on the virtual machine
and choosing:<br>
&quot;Settings &gt; General &gt; Advanced&quot; and setting &quot;Shared clipboard&quot;
to &quot;bidirectional&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="end-result">End result</h2>
<p>If you follow the above instructions roughly, you might end up with an
environment like this:</p>
<p><a href="selection_029.png"><p class="image">
    <img src="selection_029.png" alt=""  />
</p>
</a></p>
<p>So far, I'm super pleased with this setup.</p>
<h2 id="some-caveats">Some caveats</h2>
<p>I noticed the following caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>For pasting in terminals in Windows:You use Shift + Insert instead
of the normal Ctrl + Shift + V from Linux.</li>
<li>At least for Git-Bash, you need to name you ssh-keys
<code>~/.ssh/id_rsa</code>, not some custom name like <code>~/.ssh/.id_rsa_gitlab</code>,
or it won't be picked up (haven't tried with MSYS2 yet). There
should be a way to change this, but I haven't had the time to check
it up just yet.</li>
<li>Some commands, such as <code>dotnet</code>, the commandline tool for .Net core,
are not cancelleable via Ctrl + C unless you run them via <code>winpty</code>.
So, you'd run: <code>winpty dotnet</code></li>
<li>Running commands via winpty on the other hand means that you can't
pipe or redirect the outputs like normal linux commands. To solve
that, run <code>winpty -Xallow-non-tty</code></li>
<li>For dotnet, I created an alias definition
<code>alias dn='winpty -Xallow-non-tty dotnet'</code> which I put in my
<code>~/.bash_aliases</code> file.</li>
</ul>
