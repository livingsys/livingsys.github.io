  <p><em>After just <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10532957" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reading on Hacker
News</a>
 about Google&rsquo;s
newly released <a href="http://tensorflow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TensorFlow library</a>
, for deep
learning based on tensors and data flow, I realized I wrote in a draft
post back in 2013 that:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>&ldquo;What if one could have a fully declarative &ldquo;matrix language&rdquo; in
which all data transformations ever needed could be declaratively
defined in a way that is very easy to comprehend?&rdquo;</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>&hellip; so, I thought this is a good time to post this draft, to see
whether it spurs any further ideas. The following is an almost &ldquo;as is&rdquo;
copy and paste of that document from December 2013:</em></p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-matrix-an-analogy-from-physical-water-pipes">What is a Matrix? An analogy from physical water pipes</h2>
<p>A matrix is a transformation of vectors. Vectors are one-dimensional
arrays of (typically numeric) values, while a matrix is a two
dimensional array, representing a transformation of one-dimensional
vectors into other one-dimensional vectors.</p>
<p>The idea with the matrix pretty much to function as a &ldquo;conversion
table&rdquo;, where you could imagine that the input values (from a vector)
are represented as, let&rsquo;s say, the rows, while the output values are
represented by the columns.</p>
<p>Each cell in the translation matrix will be a numerical value that will
be multiplied to the input value coming in on the corresponding row (in
our example). The output for a specific column (which will be one value
in the one-dimensional output vector) will be the sum of all the values
resulting from taking the input values from the input vector, and
multiplying them each with the corresponding factor value in each cell
in the column in question.</p>
<p>As an analogy, one can imagine a matrix as a two-dimensional grid of
water pipes, where water streams into the grid from one side (let&rsquo;s say
the left side), while streaming out on another, orthogonal side (let&rsquo;s
say the upper side). Then on each cross-section, there is a tap with
which you can adjust, for every output pipe, how much of the water in
the input pipes will go out on that particular output pipe.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s illustrate this with an image:</p>
<p><p class="image">

</p>
</p>
<h2 id="what-about-the-relation-between-matrices-and-data-flow">What about the relation between matrices and data flow?</h2>
<p>It seems that this way of representing and executing a transformation is
effectively a kind of atomic data flow (the output will be produced
fully only after the full input is produced, and no meaningful
intermediate state will be passed in between).</p>
<p>It should thus be very interesting to research how this analogy could be
used in the area of dataflow / <a href="http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flow based
programming</a>
, to make the data
transformations happening in the processes to be more declarative.</p>
<p><em>What if one could have a fully declarative &ldquo;matrix language&rdquo; in which
all data transformations ever needed could be declaratively defined in a
way that is very easy to comprehend?</em></p>
<p>[EDIT]: More precisely, it would be <em><strong>a declarative language for
describing general atomic operations between dataflow streams.</strong></em></p>
<p>There are some things that might be interesting to explore with this
idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Could this make it easier to make transformations more easily run in
parallel, using so called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SIMD
instructions</a>
 in the CPU? The
fact that the transformations are atomic should help to this end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would one extend the idea to general data types, not just linear
transformations? Could the notion of a spreadsheet be helpful here?
The difference for a spreadsheet is that the definition of the
transformation is done solely in the &ldquo;resulting box&rdquo;, whereas in a
matrix, there are in fact two transformations done: One (the
multiplication) is done for each of the incoming data items, while
the other one (the summation of all the multiplied values) is done
for the individually transformed values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In fact, this leads directly to the Map / Reduce paradigm. The map
operation is done for each incoming data item, while reduce is done
to &ldquo;collect&rdquo; or &ldquo;collapse&rdquo; the mapped values into a result &hellip; so
then the Map and the reduce steps are completely up to the developer
to implement, and can be different for each column, or even
column/row combination! â†’ That definitely should make the
computation at least partly very well parallelizable (the map
step!)</p>
<p>So, in terms of the flowing water mixer, if we write out where the
maps and reduces happen, it would look something like this:</p>
<p><p class="image">
    <img src="matrix02.png" alt=""  />
</p>
</p>
<p>&hellip; where the map happens in every &ldquo;tap&rdquo;, while the reduce steps
happens once for each &ldquo;column&rdquo; of taps (shown with the red arrows).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a question though, about what to represent as the
&ldquo;dimensions&rdquo; here though. In linear algebra one often has a good
sense of what the numerical values for the different positions in an
array means (such as x,y,z coordinates in space), but when dealing
with custom data structures, it might be more ambiguous, which means
that there will be a different matrix design for every data
structure &hellip; or else: IF we could have a universal set of field
types, a sparse matrix representation, spanning (including) all
these possible values both on its input and output sides, could do.</p>
