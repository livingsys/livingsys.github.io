  <p>One year left to the dissertation (we hope) and now turning from mostly
software development into more of data analysis and needing to read up quite a
pile of books and papers on my actual topic, pharmaceutical bioinformatics.
With this background, I&rsquo;m feel forced to ponder ways to improving my note
taking workflow.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I&rsquo;m already quite happy with the way of taking notes
I&rsquo;ve settled on, using a lot of drawings and often iterating over the same
notes multiple times to ask questions, fill in details, and figure out
connections. The main remaining question for me is instead about tools.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m constantly digging into a wide variety of topics, reading,
thinking, and also trying to memorize a bit, it sometimes seems paper
might not completely cut it - primarily since paper is not searchable.
As the collection of notes grow, it also becomes unprohibitive to lug
around piles of paper-notebooks just to have them handy when needing to
check something up.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve been doing so far is to combine paper-based notebooks for
thinking and developing ideas, with a <a href="https://github.com/samuell/mdnote" target="_blank" rel="noopener">markdown based
solution</a>
, for keeping a daily
journal, as well as having a folder of such markdown files organized
more according to topic, remotely like a wiki. The problem is that these
two solutions (paper notebooks and the markdown solution) become two
non-integrated entities and only one of them remains searchable and
following my computer when switching between home and office or while
travelling.</p>
<p>Basically, I&rsquo;d love to use a Surface Pro 4 with OneNote, and the
question would be set, but OneNote doesn&rsquo;t run on my OS of choice,
Xubuntu, and nor would it be a good idea to use one&rsquo;s main laptop as a
note taking device anyhow, as I need to be able work with the notes
while coding on my main computer. And Microsoft hardware these days is
so ridiculously expensive that buying a surface as a separate device
seems pretty much out of question.</p>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m quite surprised that there are so few options that fulfil
the criteria for a good all-round note taking solution. A lot of people
suggest solutions like Evernote (and a whole array of other very
text-centric solutions) as alternatives to OneNote, but I think they
totally miss the main point of OneNote: The strong stylus-support. I
would not call any solution that does not allow you to seamlessly
&ldquo;think on screen&rdquo; with a stylus a full-fledge note taking solution.
Keeping hand-notes as vectors, natively saved in the notebooks and being
able to turn any hand-writing into text for searchability, is pretty
unique for OneNote.</p>
<p>But so, I&rsquo;m in this dilemma. Anybody else been in the same situation
and has some advice?</p>
