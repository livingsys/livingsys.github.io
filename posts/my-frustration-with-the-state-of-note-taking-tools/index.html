<p>As I'm constantly digging into a wide variety of topics, reading,
thinking, and also trying to memorize a bit, it sometimes seems paper
might not completely cut it - primarily since paper is not searchable.
As the collection of notes grow, it also becomes unprohibitive to lug
around piles of paper-notebooks just to have them handy when needing to
check something up.</p>
<p>What I've been doing so far is to combine paper-based notebooks for
thinking and developing ideas, with a <a href="https://github.com/samuell/mdnote">markdown based
solution</a>, for keeping a daily
journal, as well as having a folder of such markdown files organized
more according to topic, remotely like a wiki. The problem is that these
two solutions (paper notebooks and the markdown solution) become two
non-integrated entities and only one of them remains searchable and
following my computer when switching between home and office or while
travelling.</p>
<p>Basically, I'd love to use a Surface Pro 4 with OneNote, and the
question would be set, but OneNote doesn't run on my OS of choice,
Xubuntu, and nor would it be a good idea to use one's main laptop as a
note taking device anyhow, as I need to be able work with the notes
while coding on my main computer. And Microsoft hardware these days is
so ridiculously expensive that buying a surface as a separate device
seems pretty much out of question.</p>
<p>Overall, I'm quite surprised that there are so few options that fulfil
the criteria for a good all-round note taking solution. A lot of people
suggest solutions like Evernote (and a whole array of other very
text-centric solutions) as alternatives to OneNote, but I think they
totally miss the main point of OneNote: The strong stylus-support. I
would not call any solution that does not allow you to seamlessly
&quot;think on screen&quot; with a stylus a full-fledge note taking solution.
Keeping hand-notes as vectors, natively saved in the notebooks and being
able to turn any hand-writing into text for searchability, is pretty
unique for OneNote.</p>
<p>But so, I'm in this dilemma. Anybody else been in the same situation
and has some advice?</p>
