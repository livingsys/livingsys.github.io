  <h1>NGS Bioinformatics Intro Course Day 2</h1>

  
  
  
  <time datetime="2015-02-10T20:44:00&#43;01:00">February 10, 2015</time>

  <p>Today was the second day of the <a href="http://uppnex.se/twiki/do/view/Courses/NgsIntro1502/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introductory course in NGS
bioinformatics</a>

that I&rsquo;m taking as part of my PhD studies.</p>
<p><p class="image">
    <img src="20150210_132439.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
</p>
<p>For me it started with a substantial oversleep, probably due to a
combination of an annoying cold and the ~2 hour commute from south
Stockholm to Uppsala and <a href="http://www.bmc.uu.se/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BMC</a>
. Thus I missed
some really interesting
<a href="http://uppnex.se/twiki/pub/Courses/NgsIntro1502/Schedule/dahlo-filetypes.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">material</a>

(and
<a href="http://uppnex.se/twiki/do/view/Courses/NgsIntro1502/FileTypes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tutorial</a>
)
on file types in NGS analysis, but will make sure to go through that in
my free time during the week.</p>
<p>I came to the lecture quite fittingly, exactly when Olga
Vinnere-Petterson were going from the &ldquo;older&rdquo; NGS techniques that I
already know fairly well (454, etc), and into the newer ones, such as
PacBio and IonTorrent.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Adam Ameur covered some examples of typical analysis
workflows for NGS data, taken from their real-world projects. This was
super-interesting, and really gave a glimpse into what NGS analysis
often looks like in practice.</p>
<p>A common theme for the day was constrasting of different types of
Next-gen sequencing machines, their specific quality characteristics,
and the subsequent impact on the analytics of its data.</p>
<p>In some of the final slides, we had this kind of &ldquo;overview&rdquo; of the
main three technologies today:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use illumina when you need a really large amount data (reads), for
the buck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IonTorrent can be nice for certain applications (forgot exactly
what! =P ), at a reasonable cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use PacBio when you want great quality: The single-molecule very
long-reads sequencing, can resolve all kinds of problems with the
other methods, making de novo assembly and various correction and
validation easier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A more comprehensive summary was also prestented:</p>
<p><p class="image">
    <img src="ngsintro_ngstech_summary.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there is also some upcoming really interesting technologies, some
of which is already available at SciLifeLab:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Illumina HiSeq X Ten machines, which can sequence 320 human
whole genome sequences per week!</p>
<ul>
<li>(Hint: This will put an enormous pressure on the downstream
analysis pipeline and infrastructure! &hellip; something that goes
well in hand with our research in <a href="http://www.farmbio.uu.se/forskning/researchgroups/pb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ola Spjuth&rsquo;s
group</a>
 at
<a href="http://www.farmbio.uu.se/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dept. for Pharm. Biosciences</a>
, on
how to automate handling of really large datasets, using
workflow tools and big data technologies etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/151086-minion-a-complete-dna-sequencer-on-a-usb-stick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MinION &ldquo;sequencer on an USB
stick&rdquo;</a>

by <a href="https://www.nanoporetech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxford Nanopore tech</a>
 , that has
a suggested pricetag around $50 USD! (wow!):</p>
<p><p class="image">

</p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another nice picture of the MinION, that shows just how handy it
is - just plug it to your laptop, and pipette your sample onto it!

</p>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some other random learnings from today was:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Most if not all of the sequencing machines provide raw data (reads) in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FastQ</a>
 format, that contains the
sequences of the reads (short fragments of DNA &hellip; the Next Gen sequencing
methods build upon the technique of ripping DNA into small fragments, and
sequencing them in parallel, to gain performance)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://scilifelab.se" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SciLifeLab</a>
 here in Sweden happens to be the 3rd best
equipped sequencing center in Europe, after
<a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sanger</a>
 in the UK, and
<a href="http://www.decode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deCode</a>
 on Island.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam Ameur noted that Bacterial genome sequencing is &ldquo;pretty much solved&rdquo; (in
that one can easily assemble the genomes in a high quality enough to not have
that many ambiguities left), using the longer reads of the PacBio sequencer,
possibly corrected with shorter (but higher number of) reads from e.g. an
illumina machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam also mentioned a really interesting <a href="http://blog.pacificbiosciences.com/2014/02/data-release-54x-long-read-coverage-for.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data released by
PacBio</a>

where they sequenced and assembled <em>de novo</em>, the human genome to 54X
coverage depth:</p>

</p>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally the course participants had the chance to shortly present their own
on-going projects and to discuss any questions they might have related to that.
We had quite some discussion on the suitable number of samples, and it was
concluded that 3 well functioning samples is the absolute minimum (of course),
but that one should always strive to have a bit more, as a margin, since
otherwise if one of them is dropped for any reason (low quality or other
problems), you&rsquo;re smoked. Also it was noted that just &ldquo;technical samples&rdquo;
(taking multiple times from the same material) is not as interesting as
&ldquo;biological samples&rdquo; (multiple cells / tissue samples, but optimally even
multiple donors).</p>
<p>All in all, it was a highly interesting day, with a lot of discussion of
the intricacies of data analysis in the face of messy data, which has to
involve various quality control measures, and ways to handle that, etc.</p>
<p>Now looking forward to tomorrow (or today, as I write this blog post one
day late, on the train to the course), <a href="http://uppnex.se/twiki/do/view/Courses/NgsIntro1502/Schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wednesday, when we will dive
into the core of the course, with &ldquo;Alignment with BWA; Samtools; Data
Processing with Picard; Variant Calling with GATK; SAM/BAM and VCF
Formats&rdquo;</a>
