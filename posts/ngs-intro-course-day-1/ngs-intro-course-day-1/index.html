  <p>Just finished day 1 of the <a href="samuel.lampa.co/posts/introductory-course-in-bioinformatics-for-ngs-data/">introductory course on Bioinformatics for
Next generation sequencing
data</a>
at Scilifelab Uppsala. Attaching a photo from one of the hands-on
tutorial sessions, with the tutorial leaders, standing to the right.</p>

<p>Today's content was mostly introductions to the linux commandline in
general, and the <a href="http://www.uppmax.uu.se">UPPMAX HPC environment</a> in
particular, an area I'm already very familiar with, after two years as
a sysadmin at UPPMAX. Thus, today I mostly got to help out the other
students a bit.</p>
<p>By the way, this strong focus on getting everybody into using the linux
commandline, rather than just throwing an easy-to-use to use GUI to
them, seems to be something that is not super common out there
internationally (and something that we touch on in our lessons learned
article, from implementing the UPPNEX resource). It is something that is
widely acclaimed though, here at <a href="http://scilifelab.se/">SciLifeLab</a>
among most if not everybody who has already made their way into the
world of commandline use. GUIs are typically - in popular opinion here -
way too constraining for the juggling around of terabytes of data
between different storage systems etc, that is so typical to many NGS
analysis use cases.</p>
<p>Anyways, in the time between student questions, I also browsed around on
a very interesting site with introductory bioinformatics materials that
someone sent me:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/iua1/courses/2014-BMMB-852.html">Course in &quot;Applied Bioinformatics 2014&quot; at Penn State
University</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This course is created by the creator of widely used
questions-and-answers site <a href="biostars.org">biostars.org</a>, and seems to
contain tons of very good and very hands-on and practical material. I
will probably continue digging through this material after the current
course is finished (which is also when I should have a better head start
into the field).</p>
<p>In spite of mostly focusing on linux introduction, I anyways picked up
the first &quot;NGS bioinformatics&quot; nugget for today:</p>
<p>The &quot;rule-of-thumbish&quot; kind of fact that a typical steps in an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exome">exome</a> analysis consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filtering out low quality reads</li>
<li>Aligning of the reads to a reference genome</li>
<li>Finding all the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism">SNPs (Single Nucleotide
Polymophisms)</a>
in the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, in the afternoon, after most students had came over the
initial linux commandline hurdle, I found some time to test out the
python based, and
&quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">make</a>-inspired&quot;
workflow tool
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/johanneskoester/snakemake">snakemake</a>. I have
heard good things about snakemake from a large number of folks I know,
so it has been on my shortlist to check out (Otherwise, I'm mostly
familiar with tools like Spotify's
<a href="https://github.com/spotify/luigi">Luigi</a>, <a href="galaxyproject.org">Galaxy</a>,
<a href="https://ccg.murdoch.edu.au/yabi">Yabi</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ssadedin/bpipe/">BPipe</a> and
<a href="nextflow.io">Nextflow</a>).</p>
<p>Snakemake left me so far with a largely positive impression, for it's
terse and efficient syntax, great logging and visualization facilites
and even a web based GUI to contorl jobs. Still, there were also a
number of things that left me not totally sold, such as the python 3
support (which will cause incompatibility with numpy &amp; co), the somewhat
backwardish make syntax (you specify what file patter you want to get in
the end, rather than feeding your pipeline with any indata you have).
Will have to continue testing it out in the near future to see how
bad/not-so-bad those things are.</p>
<p>Anyways, this should be well enough for today. Now looking forward to
getting in to the <a href="http://uppnex.se/twiki/do/view/Courses/NgsIntro1502/Schedule">&quot;real&quot; bioinformatics content tomorrow
tuesday</a>
(starting with a walk-through of common file formats used in NGS
analysis).</p>
