  <p>When I presented a poster about
<a href="https://github.com/samuell/scicommander" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SciCommander</a>
 at the <a href="https://livesys.se/posts/scicommander-0.3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swedish bioinformatics workshop</a>
 last year,
I got a lot of awesome feedback from some great people including Fredrik
Boulund, Johannes Alneberg and others, of which I unfortunately lost the names
(please shout out if you read this!).</p>
<p>(For those new to SciCommander, it is my attempt at creating a tool that can
track complete provenance reports also for ad-hoc shell commands, not just
those included in a pipeline. The grand plan is also to integrate this
provenance tracking with those of popular pipelines, to enable seamless
provenance report generation across pipelines and ad-hoc commands).</p>
<p>Anyways, the discussions we had at SBW lead to an idea for a much improved
approach for detecting input- and output files, that I have now finally had
time to implement. This means that now, no extra syntax at all is needed to
mark inputs and outputs. It is all auto-detected!</p>
<p>The only thing required is to somehow run the command via SciCommander. This can be
done in one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prepend the command with <code>sci run</code>. If doing this, you must also either
quote the entire command after these commands, or quote each piping
character such as <code>|</code> or <code>&gt;</code>. This is so that bash doesn&rsquo;t capture those
instead of sending them as parameters to <code>sci run</code>.</li>
<li>The alternative is to start a fake shell with <code>sci shell</code>. Here you can
write your commands completely as you would in normal bash! You even have
auto-completion for files in the current folder, programs available in your
<code>$PATH</code> etc.  The only caveat is that this is not really a real shell,
meaning that some things are missing, such as command history. I&rsquo;ll continue
to look for ways to improve this situation, but think this works as a start.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a side-note, while implementing the improved version, I at the same time
rewrote the whole app in Go instead of Python. This should make SciCommmander
much less likely to cause problems with existing python environments, as it is
now shipped as a completely stand-alone binary. It will also make sure that
commands are always super-snappy, even if we add more complex logic in the
future.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure to present the updated SciCommander version as an updated
poster at the Pandemic Laboratory Preparedness retreat last week.  The tool
makes particular sense in this context since it has the potential to let you
keep full provenance and audit tracing of your analyses even when you didn&rsquo;t
have time to create a well defined pipeline for it. Something that can be
particularly important in crisis situations such as pandemics.</p>
<p>I hope to present it at some upcoming events more targeted towards
bioinformaticians too, such as perhaps <a href="https://www.sbw2024.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SBW2024 in Uppsala</a>
.
Perhaps see you there!</p>
