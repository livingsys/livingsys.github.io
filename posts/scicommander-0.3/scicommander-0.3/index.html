  <p>I haven't written much about a new tool I've been working on in some
extra time: <a href="https://github.com/samuell/scicommander">SciCommander</a>.</p>
<p>I just presented a poster about it at the <a href="https://sbw2023.nu">Swedish Bioinformatics
Workshop 2023</a> , so perhaps let me first present you
the poster instead of re-iterating what it is (click to view large
version):</p>
<p><a href="/site/assets/files/1116/scicmd-poster-export-007.png"><img src="/site/assets/files/1116/scicmd-poster-export-007.480x0-is.png" alt="">{width=&ldquo;480&rdquo;}</a></p>
<h3 id="new-version-not-requiring-running-the-scicmd-command">New version not requiring running the scicmd command</h3>
<p>I got a lot of great feedback from numerous people at the conference,
most of who pointed out that it would be great if one could start
scicommander as a kind of subshell, inside which one can run commands as
usual, instead of running them via the <code>scicmd -c</code> command.</p>
<p>We were also discussing about ways to automatically figure out which
parts of the command are input- and output files, so that one would not
need to specify that with i: and o: markers.</p>
<p>Today, I managed to implement a solution for the first of these wishes,
by using some clever Bash tricks that people out on the internet
recommended. These are published in the last <a href="https://pypi.org/project/scicommander/0.3.3/">version 0.3.3, out on the
Python Package Index
(PyPI)</a> now!</p>
<p>So now, given that you have a bash environment, you can install the
latest SciCommander with:</p>
<pre><code>lang-bash
pip install -U scicommander
</code></pre>
<p>... and then enter the SciCommander shell with:</p>
<pre><code>lang-bash
scishell
</code></pre>
<p>Now, executing commands inside will look almost as usual ... only the
<code>i:</code> and <code>o:</code> markers are still required (but working on fixing that too</p>
<ul>
<li>stay tuned! :) ):</li>
</ul>

<p>Have you tried it out? Feedback?</p>
