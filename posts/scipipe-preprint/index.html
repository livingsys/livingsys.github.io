<p>It has been more than three years since the first commit on the <a href="https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe">SciPipe
Git repository</a> in March, 2015, and
development has been going in various degrees of intensity during these
years, often besides other duties at <a href="https://pharmb.io/">pharmb.io</a> and
<a href="https://nbis.se/">NBIS</a>, and often at a lower pace than I might have
wished. On the other hand, this might also have helped to let design
ideas mature well before implementing them.</p>
<p>There is definitely no lack of workflow tools in bioinformatics, which
lists <a href="https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline">like this</a> attest
to, and there are also a core bunch of tools that have crystallized as
popular tools among a wide range of users. So why would we still spend
all this time on developing yeat another workflow library?</p>
<p>Well, let me start with saying that I think development of new tools and
libraries can serve more than one purpose. Despite the many tools
available, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13062-015-0071-8">many users of these still experience many limitations with
them</a>. Furthermore I think
development of new tools and approaches doesn't need to be seen as
necessarily new competitors to other tools, or fragmenting the existing
tool landscape, but rather as experimentation. Successful approaches
could later be adopted by other tools too, which might not be as free to
do experimentation when there is a large user base already. A kind of
research, that is. The many frustrations some users experience with
workflows suggests that this is a well needed field of research as well,
to make computational science more robust, reproducible and also
understandable.</p>
<p>With that said, to explain the development of SciPipe, I think the
easiest is to briefly tell the story of our use and research in workflow
tools over the last couple of years. Here comes.</p>
<p>We have spent the last couple of years using workflow tools to build
predictive machine learning models in early drug discovery. Based on
extensive research of existing tools, we first settled on the <a href="https://github.com/spotify/luigi">Luigi
library</a> for this task. We quickly
learned though that machine learning workflows have specific
requirements not common in general bioinformatics pipelines, such as
very high number of tasks due to nested parameter sweeps and cross
validation folds, and the need parametrize the final training with hyper
parameters optimized during the workflow run, creating the need for so
called dynamic scheduling.</p>
<p>Luigi was not completely living up to our requirement, and so we tried
to fix the situation by developing a helper library,
<a href="https://github.com/pharmbio/sciluigi">SciLuigi</a> (previously <a href="http://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-016-0179-6">published
in J Chemin</a>f). After a year
of using Luigi+SciLuigi, we started to experience limitations with this
solution too though. It still lacked dynamic scheduling and we
experienced performance and robustness problems with Luigi&rsquo;s interpreted
Python core, which slowed down development a lot.</p>
<p>To solve these remaining problems we took our experiences from SciLuigi
and applied it on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming">flow-based
programming</a> (FBP)
inspired scheduler in <a href="http://golang.org">Go</a> (if you can call it a
scheduler, as scheduling happens implicit as part of the dataflow/FBP
design!), resulting in the SciPipe library.</p>
<p>We have subsequently used SciPipe over the last year for <a href="https://github.com/pharmbio/ptp-project">building
machine learning models in drug
discovery</a>, and are so far
extremely pleased with our experiences. The performance problems are
gone and the dynamic scheduling lets us keep the workflow definition
integrated, so we can produce coherent audit logs and workflow graphs,
among other things.</p>
<p>We thus think SciPipe can fill an important role for complex workflows
in machine learning in particular, but we have also made sure that it
works well for more traditional genomics and transcriptomics
applications, to avoid the need to use different workflow tools for each
problem. More info on this is available in the
<a href="www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/08/01/380808">preprint</a>.</p>
