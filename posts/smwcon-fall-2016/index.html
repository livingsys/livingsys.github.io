  <p>[I was invited to give a talk at ]<a href="https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/SMWCon_Fall_2016/Conference_Days" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semantic MediaWiki (SMW)
conference</a>
[
(SMWCon) in Frankfurt last week, on our work on enabling import of RDF datasets
into ]<a href="https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SMW</a>

nice to re-connect with some old friends, and to get up to date about how SMW
is developing, as well as share about our own contributions.]</p>

<h2 id="the-talk---on-rdf-import-in-semantic-mediawiki">The Talk - on RDF Import in Semantic MediaWiki</h2>
<p>[My talk this year was titled &ldquo;Batch import of large RDF datasets using
RDFIO or the new rdf2smw tool&rdquo;. More info can be found on the

<h2 id="smw-and-smwcon">SMW and SMWCon</h2>
<p>Firstly, just for info, note that I and a few others tweeted quite
extensively during the conference, summarized in this
<a href="https://storify.com/smllmp/semantic-mediawiki-conference-fall-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storyboard</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="the-state-of-smw">The state of SMW</h2>
<p>I otherwise find SMW and SMWCon to have quite an interesting
development. Eventhough being a technology developed more than 10 years
ago (the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11926078_68" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SMW paper</a>
 was
published 10 years ago), it is still a thriving community with an active
group of developers, (although it turns out the majority of core
development is done by one person, &ldquo;<a href="http://github.com/mwjames" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JamesHK /
MWJames</a>
&rdquo;). Many other softwares coming from
the same time seem to have been slowly dying to a much larger extent.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the reasons for this fact, I think <a href="https://storify.com/smllmp/semantic-mediawiki-conference-fall-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Markus
Glaser</a>

summarized one reason pretty well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;MediaWiki is like a white sheet of paper for data.&rdquo; -
<a href="https://twitter.com/mrglaser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@mrglaser</a>

<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SMWCon?src=hash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#SMWCon</a>
</p>
<p>&mdash; WikiWorks (<a href="http://twitter.com/wikiworks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@wikiworks</a>
) <a href="https://twitter.com/wikiworks/status/781775961213763584" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30
september
2016</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This goes well along my own reflections, that MediaWiki with its very
stable platform (it has to support Wikipedia for many decades to come)
and robust import / export facilities, diff-able history and much more,
makes it a robust platform upon which to innovate with new technology.
Always having the robust underlying text-editing platform means that
even if some new extension on top of it bit-rots and stops working, you
won&rsquo;t lose your data or your wiki. You can just disable any bit-rotted
extensions and go on with life.</p>
<p>I think this also one reason that makes SMW itself so powerful: Even
though SMW has really powerful features, I think its most attractive
feature is that the underlying foundation is something you will always
be able to manage and which will not suddenly break or bit-rot: after
all, it is <em>just text</em>.</p>
<p>I think this aligns well with the recent developments towards keeping
development environments purely text-based at their core, which enables
using powerful version control software such as git, as well as makes it
easy to automate development workflows. Interestingly, in the last talk
of the conference (which I sadly missed due to an early flight) I heard
that <a href="http://twitter.com/hexmode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark A. Herschberger</a>
 showed some nice
integration of MediaWiki and git. Looking forward to see the video <a href="https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/SMWCon_Fall_2016/Multilateral,_asynchronous,_bidirectional_synchronisation_of_wikis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">show
up here
later</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="smw-for-biology-labs">SMW for biology labs</h2>
<p>For me as a life science researcher-to-be, it was nice to see I was not
the only life scientist at the conference. I enjoyed listening to <a href="https://twitter.com/toniher" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toni
Hermoso&rsquo;s</a>
 talk &ldquo;<a href="https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/SMWCon_Fall_2016/Semantic_MediaWiki_as_a_platform_for_lab_management_and_biological_annotation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semantic MediaWiki as a
platform for lab management and biological
annotation</a>
&rdquo;
(<a href="http://slides.com/similis/semantic-mediawiki-as-a-platform-for-lab-management-and#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slides
here</a>
).
Interestingly, they have integrated common tools for next-gen sequenging
analysis into a wiki, including FASTA and GFF viewers, and, a genome
browser(!):</p>
<p><p class="image">
    <img src="smw_genome_browser.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
</p>
<p>&hellip; and, they have a really nice <a href="http://proteowiki.crg.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lab website powered by
SMW</a>
 too :)</p>
<p>Toni&rsquo;s full slides:</p>
<h3 id="more-random-notes-and-links">More random notes and links</h3>
<p>[I will end this post with a few random links and notes I found
interesting:]</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/khoffmeyer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karsten Hoffmeyer</a>
, mentioned that
SMW 2.5 will come with support for adding provenance info to the
semantic facts, to be able to track where info comes from!</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/nightrose" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lydia Pintcher</a>
 of the very
interesting wikidata project (making the data in wikipedia machine
readable etc) highlighted that <a href="http://wikiba.se" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the software behind wikidata,
wikibase is fully open source, and avilable to
download</a>
.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/SoerenAuer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sören Auer</a>
, in his talk &ldquo;<a href="https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/SMWCon_Fall_2016/Semantic_MediaWiki_and_Open_Scholarly_Communication" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SMW and
Open Scholarly
Communication</a>
&rdquo;
mentioned <a href="https://dokie.li/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dokie.li</a>
, a decentralized paper
editor with support for cool things like SPARQL queries, right in
your manuscript!</li>
<li>Sören mentioned also <a href="http://slidewiki.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SlideWiki</a>
 - for
collaboratively creating slides for educational use</li>
<li>Sören finally also mentioned
<a href="http://openresearch.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenResearch.org</a>
 - an SMW powered wiki
that tries to aggregate scholarly events, organizations, people,
journals and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>[Overall, I was happy to see the SMW development and community still
going strong!]{style=&ldquo;line-height: 22.4px;&rdquo;}</p>
