<pre><code>lang-bash
wget -P . -mpck --html-extension -e robots=off --wait 0.5 &lt;URL&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>To understand the flags, you can check `man wget` of course, but some
explanations follow here:</p>
<ul>
<li>-P - Tell where to store the site</li>
<li>-m - Create a mirror</li>
<li>-p - Download all the required files (.css, .js) needed to properly
render the page</li>
<li>-c - Continue getting partially downloaded files</li>
<li>-k - Convert links to enable local viewing</li>
<li>--html-extension - Add the .html extension after file names. This
is important since when serving the plain files, a web server such
as NGinx need the .html extension to know that the files should be
sent directly to the user's browser, not offered as a file to
download. See below for how to redirect from old to new links.</li>
<li>-e robots=off - Don't read the robots.txt file. Not sure exactly
how this one works, but I got a lot of errors if not including it.</li>
<li>--wait 0.5 - It is better to not overwhelm the web server where
your site is hosted, by waiting a little between each page download.</li>
</ul>
<p>After finishing this command, you will have a folder with static
HTML-files and other files, that you can just upload to your web server
instead of your CMS.</p>
<p>Finally, you might want to add this rule to the Nginx config, to make
sure the old non-.html URLs are redirected to the .html variant:</p>
<pre><code>lang-nginx
location / {
    if ($request_filename !~* (/|(.+)\.(html|css|js|gif|png|jpg))$ ) {
        rewrite ^(.+)$ $1.html permanent;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Add these lines in the appropriate server config in the relevant file,
such as /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default.</p>
<p>What the rule does, is that for all URLs which are not the home page (/)
or static files with any of the common file extensions, it will redirect
to the same URL with '.html' padded on at the end.</p>
<p>That's it! Visit my now archived old blog at
<a href="https://saml.rilspace.com">saml.rilspace.com</a> for an example if you
wish!</p>
