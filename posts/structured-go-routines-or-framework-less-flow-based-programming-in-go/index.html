  <p>I was so happy the other day to find someone else who found the great
benefits of a little pattern for how to structure pipeline-heavy
programs in Go, which I described in a few posts before. I have been
surprised to not find more people using this kind of pattern, which has
been so extremely helpful to us, so I thought to take this opportunity
to re-iterate it again, in the hopes that more people might get aware of
it.</p>
<p>The pattern is very pedagogically explained by <a href="https://github.com/eapache" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evan
Huus</a>
 (twitter handle anyone?) in his talk about complex pipeline patterns in
Go (also from 2015), <a href="https://youtu.be/2HOO5gIgyMg?t=1855" target="_blank" rel="noopener">starting from
30:55</a>
 and just 1&ndash;2 minutes onward. He explains it very
neatly in just a few slides, so I urge you to have a look:</p>
<p>&hellip; where this slide summarizes Evan&rsquo;s Idea:</p>
<p><p class="image">

</p>
</p>
<p>This is pretty much exactly the idea I have suggested in a
<a href="https://blog.gopheracademy.com/composable-pipelines-pattern/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a>
, and a <a href="https://blog.gopheracademy.com/advent-2015/composable-pipelines-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">follow-up
post</a>
 on GopherAcademy in 2015, and later packaged up in a
helper library I&rsquo;ve called
<a href="http://flowbase.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FlowBase</a>
. It
is also the exact idea is also the basis of the
<a href="http://scipipe.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SciPipe</a>

(<a href="https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a>
) batch workflow / pipeline library, for which we
recently published a <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/380808v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">technical preprint
paper</a>
.</p>
<p>I presented these ideas and results at the <a href="https://eventbrite.com/e/go-stockholm-conference-tickets-49325007425" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go Stockholm conference
2018</a>
.
You can find my slides below, titled <a href="//www.slideshare.net/SamuelLampa/using-flowbased-programming-to-write-tools-and-workflows-for-scientific-computing-in-go" title="Using Flow-based programming to write tools and workflows for Scientific
