  <p>I was so happy the other day to find someone else who found the great
benefits of a little pattern for how to structure pipeline-heavy
programs in Go, which I described in a few posts before. I have been
surprised to not find more people using this kind of pattern, which has
been so extremely helpful to us, so I thought to take this opportunity
to re-iterate it again, in the hopes that more people might get aware of
it.</p>
<p>The pattern is very pedagogically explained by <a href="https://github.com/eapache">Evan
Huus</a>{.markup&ndash;anchor .markup&ndash;p-anchor}
(twitter handle anyone?) in his talk about complex pipeline patterns in
Go (also from 2015), <a href="https://youtu.be/2HOO5gIgyMg?t=1855">starting from
30:55</a>{.markup&ndash;anchor
.markup&ndash;p-anchor} and just 1&ndash;2 minutes onward. He explains it very
neatly in just a few slides, so I urge you to have a look:</p>
<p>... where this slide summarizes Evan's Idea:</p>
<p><img src="/site/assets/files/1092/selection_999_136.png" alt="">{width=&ldquo;558&rdquo;
height=&ldquo;313&rdquo;}</p>
<p>This is pretty much exactly the idea I have suggested in a
<a href="https://blog.gopheracademy.com/composable-pipelines-pattern/">post</a>{.markup&ndash;anchor
.markup&ndash;p-anchor}, and a <a href="https://blog.gopheracademy.com/advent-2015/composable-pipelines-improvements/">follow-up
post</a>{.markup&ndash;anchor
.markup&ndash;p-anchor} on GopherAcademy in 2015, and later packaged up in a
helper library I&rsquo;ve called
<a href="http://flowbase.org">FlowBase</a>{.markup&ndash;anchor .markup&ndash;p-anchor}. It
is also the exact idea is also the basis of the
<a href="http://scipipe.org/">SciPipe</a>{.markup&ndash;anchor .markup&ndash;p-anchor}
(<a href="https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe">Github</a>{.markup&ndash;anchor
.markup&ndash;p-anchor}) batch workflow / pipeline library, for which we
recently published a <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/380808v1">technical preprint
paper</a>{.markup&ndash;anchor
.markup&ndash;p-anchor}.</p>
<p>I presented these ideas and results at the <a href="https://eventbrite.com/e/go-stockholm-conference-tickets-49325007425">Go Stockholm conference
2018</a>.
You can find my slides below, titled <a href="//www.slideshare.net/SamuelLampa/using-flowbased-programming-to-write-tools-and-workflows-for-scientific-computing-in-go" title="Using Flow-based programming to write tools and workflows for Scientific Computing in Go">Using Flow-based programming to
