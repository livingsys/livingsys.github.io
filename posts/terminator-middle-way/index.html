  <p>I have tried hard to improve my linux desktop productivity by learning
to do as much as possible using keyboard shortcuts, aliases for terminal
commands etc etc (I even produced an <a href="https://www.udemy.com/command-line-productivity/?couponCode=BlogR33ders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online course on linux commandline
productivity</a>
).</p>
<p>In this spirit, I naturally tried out a so called <a href="https://www.udemy.com/command-line-productivity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tiling window
manager</a>
 (aka tiling
wm). In short, a tiling wm organizes all open windows on the screen (or
on the current desktop) into a &ldquo;tiled&rdquo; grid of frames. You can then
control how these frames are created, resized, as well as switch focus
between the frames, all using keyboard shortcuts. This allows you to
avoid leaving the keyboard for moving windows around or resizing them,
before starting your work in a new program.</p>
<p>I quickly realized though that tiling wms don&rsquo;t seem to be by far as
mature as normal so called &ldquo;floating window managers&rdquo;. It might be
specific to ubuntu/xubuntu, but I realized that things like the
wifi-manager applet is kind of dependent on the floating wm. You can
find alternatives such as &hellip;, but it is not at all as much an &ldquo;it
just works&rdquo; experience.</p>
<p>Thus I was very glad when I found out about
<a href="http://gnometerminator.blogspot.se/p/introduction.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">terminator</a>
.
Terminator basically allows you to do the same thing that tiling window
managers does, but limits it to terminals. The nice thing with
terminator though is that it works great together with your favourite
floating window manager. I have set my terminator to start in full
screen mode, and to have slight transparency, so that I can keep track
of things that happen in the background, such as notifications in my web
browser etc:</p>

</p>
</p>
<p>(I have added a few other settings too, so you might be interested in
checkout out my <a href="https://github.com/samuell/rc/blob/master/.config/terminator/config" target="_blank" rel="noopener">terminator config
file</a>
).</p>
<p>Then, for avoiding to leave your keyboard the few times I need to use a
non-commandline-program, there is also a good solution, provided you use
XFCE as window manager: XFCE Allows you to set keyboards for operations
such as &ldquo;tile window to the left/right/upper/lower half of the
screen&rdquo;, &ldquo;resize&rdquo;, or &ldquo;move window&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>To set this, go:</p>
<ul>
<li>Super + R</li>
<li>Type &ldquo;window manager&rdquo; and press enter</li>
<li>Select to the &ldquo;keyboard&rdquo; tab</li>
<li>Scroll down to the relevant settings</li>
<li>Set your favourite keyboard shortcuts!</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see a few of my favourites in this screenshot:</p>
<p><p class="image">

</p>
</p>
<p>Additionally, I use to set &ldquo;Ctrl + Alt + R&rdquo; for resizing windows, and
&ldquo;Ctrl + Alt + F&rdquo; for moving them (&ldquo;F&rdquo; for &ldquo;flytta&rdquo; in Swedish,
mainly because &ldquo;F&rdquo; is reachable with the left hand, but not &ldquo;M&rdquo; :)
).</p>
<p>Taken together, I find that this combination of terminator for tiling
terminals, and a few selected window managing shortcuts, has caused me
way less headache than the window manager I tried
(<a href="https://i3wm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">i3</a>
, which I otherwise liked a lot).</p>
