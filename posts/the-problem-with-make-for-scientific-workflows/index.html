<h2 id="the-workflow-problem-solved-once-and-for-all-in-1979">The workflow problem solved once and for all in 1979?</h2>
<p>As soon as the topic of scientific workflows is brought up, there are
always a few make fans fervently insisting that the problem of workflows
is solved once and for all with <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GNU
make</a>
, written first in the 70&rsquo;s :)</p>
<p>Personally I haven&rsquo;t been so sure. On the one hand, I know the tool
solves a lot of problems for many people. Also, there is something very
attractive about buildling on a tool that you can be sure will be
available on more or less every unix-like operating system, for decades
to come.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the tool seems less suited for tasks where you have a
dynamic number of outputs, such as in machine learning cross validation
tasks with variable number of folds.</p>
<p>This is due to the way you specify dependencies: Rather than just
specifying the order of the rules <em>by their names</em>, you specify the
target <em>file name pattern</em> of the desired output, and let make figure
out what rules it takes to create those. Thus when you have a variable
or dynamically computed number of outputs anywhere in the workflow, it
becomes hard - if not impossible - to know what these resulting file
patterns will be. You simply can&rsquo;t know before you started executing
the workflow.</p>
<p>Because this was just my &ldquo;intuitive understanding&rdquo;, I was quite
interested when I stumbled upon a <a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W08/W08-0503.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper that discusses this exact
problem in some
detail</a>
. In section
2.2 the authors explain a number of problems with it for the kind of use
cases I have been thinking of.</p>
<p>They list the problems under three main categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Files are represented by strings</li>
<li>[Problems with] combinatorial dependencies</li>
<li>Non-representable dependency structures.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will quote some selected parts under each of the categories, below.</p>
<h3 id="files-are-represented-by-strings">Files are represented by strings</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;&hellip; from our perspective, make is a declarative language for
specifying dependencies. This seems to be exactly what we want, and
indeed it does solve some of the problems detailed above. make has
several new problems, though, which result in its being not an ideal
solution to our problem&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;&hellip; there are three serious problems &hellip;&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;The basic problem here is that to make, a file is represented by a
string, its filename. For machine learning and natural language
processing experiments, it is much more natural to represent a file as a
set of key-value pairs. &hellip;&rdquo;</em></p>
<h3 id="problems-with-combinatorial-dependencies">[Problems with] combinatorial dependencies</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;The second problem with make is that it is very difficult to
specify combinatorial dependencies. If one continued to write the
makefile above, one would eventually need to write a final all target
to specify all the files which would need to be built. There are 60
such files [&hellip;] There is no easy way in make of listing these 60
files in a natural manner. One can escape to a shell script, or use
GNU make&rsquo;s foreach function, but both ways are messy.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="non-representable-dependency-structures">Non-representable dependency structures</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;The final problem with make also relates to dependencies. It is
more subtle, but it turns out that there are some sorts of dependency
structures which cannot be represented in make. Suppose I want to
compare the effect of using one of three parsers, one of three
part-of-speech-taggers and one of three chunkers for a summarization
experiment. This involves three separate three-way distinctions in the
makefile, where for each, there are three different commands that
might be run. A non-working example is in Figure 3. The problem is
that make pattern rules (rules using the % character) can only match
the suffix or prefix of a filename. This makefile does not work
because it requires the parser, chunker, and tagger to all be the last
part of the filename before the type suffix.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But by all means, have a look at <a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W08/W08-0503.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the
paper</a>
 for yourself!
:)</p>
<h2 id="some-comments">Some comments</h2>
<p>I find this paper interesting in that it provides concrete use cases to
a problem that I had only an intuitive understanding of before.</p>
<p>It might not completely hit the nail at its head with all the problem
description. E.g, I don&rsquo;t think being &ldquo;filename based&rdquo; versus
&ldquo;parameter based&rdquo; is a problem at all, if you just have a powerful
file name pattern mechanism that allows you to freely and flexible
incorporate the parameter names and values at any desired place in the
filename pattern. That is the case .e.g in <a href="https://github.com/spotify/luigi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spotify&rsquo;s luigi workflow
tool</a>
, which we have been using in our
work in <a href="http://www.farmbio.uu.se/forskning/researchgroups/pb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ola Spjuth&rsquo;s group at
UU</a>
.</p>
<p>The other two points, about some dependency graph patterns being
impractical to work with, seem to touch close to the heart of the
problem though. like I mentioned earlier that in make you have to
specify file name pattern of <em>the resulting dataset</em>, to drive the
<em>upstream</em> rules/tasks.</p>
<p>In cases where outputs of some tasks are either variable or when the
whole dependency graph is branching into a large number of final
targets, then specifying the final target file patterns can be extremely
impractical to specify manually.</p>
<p>For these kind of use cases it seems it would be nicer to just specify
the tasks, the indata, and how the data flows, from output of one task
to input of another one, without needing to know the final resulting
file name pattern in before hand. Thus a bit more &ldquo;push-based&rdquo;
approach compared to &ldquo;pull based&rdquo;, and also with explicit wiring of
data dependencies, rather than implicit ones based upon file name
pattern rules (That is, more &ldquo;dataflow&rdquo; or &ldquo;flow based programming&rdquo;
like).</p>
<p>Interestingly, this approach is taken in tools such as
<a href="http://www.nextflow.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NextFlow</a>
 and seemingly to a slighlty more
limited extent in tools like <a href="http://bpipe.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BPipe</a>
. (EDIT: And
definitely in our new Go-based library <a href="http://scipipe.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SciPipe</a>
).</p>
<p>It should be mentioned though that python-based
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/johanneskoester/snakemake" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SnakeMake</a>
 provides
some constructs that makes some of the problems described above a lot
more tractable to implement even though the basic execution mechanism is
&ldquo;pull-based&rdquo; just like in make itself (you specify the desired target
file pattern to drive upstream tasks) but it has a much better handling
of named inputs and outputs than GNU make, and also a more powerful file
pattern interpolation mechanism, where you can use python code to
interpolate the file pattern in any way.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope to see more dataflow inspired workflow tools in the future,
but in the meanwhile, keep an eye on NextFlow, BPipe, and also
SnakeMake, if you can live with its pull-based mechanism!</p>

<li><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I should clarify that the problems discussed below do not apply
to some ways of working with make such as this interesting method by <a href="https://twitter.com/yokofakun" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pierre
Lindenbaum</a>
, where the makefile is <a href="https://github.com/lindenb/ngsxml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generated
from an XML description</a>
, thus using make
as a kind of &ldquo;assembly language&rdquo;, to which higher level workflow
definitions are &ldquo;compiled&rdquo;. Pierre <a href="https://twitter.com/yokofakun/status/576878752673693696" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentions a few other problems with make
here though</a>
