  <p>Disclaimer: Don't take this too seriously ... this is
&quot;thinking-in-progress&quot; :)</p>
<p>It just struck me the other minute, how simplicity is the key theme
behind two very important areas in software development, that I've been
dabbling with quite a bit recently: Testing, and automation.</p>
<p>Have you thought about how testing, in its essence, is: <em>Wrapping
<strong>complex</strong> code, which you can't mentally comprehend completely, in
<strong>simple</strong> code, that you can mentally comprehend, at least one test at
a time.</em> Because, after all, if you can't easily comprehend your test
code, as to make sure it is correct, by simply looking at it, you will
have to <em>create even simpler tests that test your tests</em>!</p>
<p>In a similar way, we need to make automation code simple - again,
wrapping our <em>complex</em> code, in <em>simpler</em> code - for it to give us any
gains. Otherwise, we will fall into this common problem:</p>

<p>That is, if the motivation behind automation is to make things easier
and less time consuming, it has to be <em>simpler</em>, not under the hood, but
in the interface towards you as developer and maintainer.</p>
