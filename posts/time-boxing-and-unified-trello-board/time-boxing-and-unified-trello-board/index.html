<p><em><strong>Figure:</strong> Sketchy screenshot of how my current board looks. Notice
especially the &quot;Now&quot; stack, marked in yellow, where you are only
allowed to put <strong>one single</strong> card.</em></p>
<p>I used to have a very hard time getting an overview of my current work,
and prioritizing and concentrating on any single task for too long. I
always felt there might be something else that might be more important
than what I were currently doing. And in fact, how would I know if I
didn&rsquo;t have the overview?</p>
<p>Having two part-time works, each with multiple parallel on-going
projects with differing time-scale, as well as a lot of hobby interests
in similar areas, probably did not help the situation.</p>
<p>I had tried organizing all my projects into separate
<a href="https://trello.com/">trello-boards</a>, with detailed tasks and
check-lists and the like, but that didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>All of this changed after I read <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/snfocus/pomodoro-technique-illustrated">&ldquo;Pomodoro Technique Illustrated&rdquo;, by
Staffan
Nöteberg</a>.
The book revolves around one simple idea: Divide all your work into 25
minute work chunks and continuously during the day prioritize and select
one work chunk at a time and work on it 100% exclusively for 25 minutes
(you will set a timer that rings after that time. I just use the timer
funciton in my smartphone). After that you allow yourself a few minutes
(like, max 5) to goof out, check mail, facebook, hackernews or whatever
urges your attention &hellip; and importantly, select the next work chunk to
work on exclusively for 25 minutes.</p>
<p>I find the whole idea to be brilliant. By knowing that you will be able
to goof out a bit after the 25 minutes enables you to suppress any urges
to check up various things that hit your mind, such as checking
communication channels.</p>
<p>Nöteberg&rsquo;s book also go through practical tips on how to constantly plan
and re-prioritize your current batch of work items for a few selected
time periods, such as &ldquo;today&rdquo;, and &ldquo;this week&rdquo; and so on.</p>
<p>Anyhow, these ideas inspired me to create a much better way to organize
my trello board as well, which I&rsquo;m describing below.</p>
<p>Instead of having separate boards for each high level project, I created
one single board on which I keep all my work tasks. I simply call the
board &ldquo;time-boxing&rdquo; (another common term for the &ldquo;pomodoro technique&rdquo;).</p>
<p>In this board, inspired by Nöteberg&rsquo;s book, I have created the following
stacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>On hold</li>
<li>To do this week</li>
<li>[To do] Today</li>
<li>[To do] Now</li>
<li>Done [Month name] (Archived monthly)</li>
</ul>
<p>(I use a labels to mark which of my part-time jobs a task belongs to &hellip;
it sometimes belongs to more than one).</p>
<p>This new structure has done wonders for me! Slightly surprising, the
most important stack of these were in fact the &ldquo;Doing right now&rdquo; stack
in which, importantly, you are only allowed to have <em><strong>one single</strong></em>
card! (See the yellow marked one in the screenshot below).</p>
<p>I had not realized the power of this one and didn&rsquo;t have one. But the
&ldquo;right now&rdquo; stack is now what really helps me remember what I&rsquo;m
currently doing, even after goofing out those 5 minutes andgetting
dozens of other thought threads starting in my head, which would
normally make me lose track of even what I&rsquo;m working on right now. Now I
can just glance on that card again, and immediately be on track with
what I was supposed to do for the next 25 minutes of concentrated work.</p>
<p>In summary I can highly recommend the time-boxing technique, for anyone
having problems concentrating, amidst too many current projects and
tasks. If you want some more reading on the topic before staring,
<a href="https://pragprog.com/book/snfocus/pomodoro-technique-illustrated">Nöteberg&rsquo;s
book</a>is
a good resource.</p>
