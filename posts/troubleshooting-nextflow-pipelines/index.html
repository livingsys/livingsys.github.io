<p>We have been evaluating Nextflow before in my work at
<a href="https://pharmb.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pharmb.io</a>
, but that was before
<a href="https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DSL2</a>
 and the support
for re-usable modules (which was one reason we needed to develop our own
tools to support our challenges, as explained <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giz044" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the
paper</a>
). Thus, there&rsquo;s
definitely some stuff to get into.</p>
<p>Based on my years in bioinformatics and data science, I&rsquo;ve seen that
the number one skill that you need to develop is to be able to
effectively troubleshoot things, because things will invariably fail in
all kinds of ways. And in the process, you will probably learn a lot
about the technology stack you are using.</p>
<p>You need to be pretty intentional about developing this skill though, as
it is a skill that is seldomly taught properly in undergraduate
programs, if ever. This means it is far too often treated as a
trial-and-error practice, perhaps combined with some informed guessing.
While this can work, there are far more efficient ways.</p>
<p>Anyways, this is why I&rsquo;m writing this post. I wanted to document some
key troubleshooting techniques I have just picked up for working with
Nextflow. Some is available in the Documentation, but I didn&rsquo;t find a
coherent summary of them all, and I also learned some further tricks
through experimentation that can perhaps be contributed somewhere else
later. But to start with, they are published below. Feel free to give
feedback, and also let me know about your own favorite tips in the
comments!</p>
<h3 id="existing-troubleshooting-resources">Existing troubleshooting resources</h3>
<p>As said, Nextflow has some information on troubleshooting tools and
techniques, and the idea here is not to re-iterate them, so I&rsquo;ll start
with pointing out some of the most important ones here.</p>

<h3 id="some-further-troubleshooting-tips">Some further troubleshooting tips</h3>
<h4 id="1-the-execution-log">1. The execution log</h4>
<p>Primarily, Nextflow provides some pretty good tips itself, when an error
occurs.</p>
<p>The first thing to note, is if you get your terminal filled with error
output, and don&rsquo;t manage to read it all before it flushes by, you can
always find the latest log in a file named <code>.nextflow.log</code> inside your
execution folder.</p>
<p>To scroll through this file in a searchable way, without wrapping long
lines, I recommend to use the <code>less -S</code> command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>less -S ~/.nextflow.log
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Using less, you can search by typing <code>/</code> followed by the search phrase,
step through the search results with <code>n</code> for next find, and <code>N</code> for
previous find, scroll using arrows or PageDown/PageUp, or vim commands
for the same, as well as quit using <code>q</code>.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is easier to just &ldquo;grep&rdquo; through the file, for example
searching case-insensitively for &ldquo;error&rdquo;, and perhaps piping that to
<code>less -S</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>grep -i error .nextflow.log | less -S
</span></span></code></pre></div><h4 id="2-the-work-folder">2. The work folder</h4>
<p>At least for jobs executed locally, in the execution log mentioned
above, Nextflow typically points out the path to the &ldquo;work folder&rdquo;.
Depending on your configuration, it typically involves the word &ldquo;work&rdquo;
and ends with a long random string of letters and numbers called a
&ldquo;hash&rdquo;, for example <code>/tmp/nf/work/a3/0e2ea68c421ced4797e00de9e73155</code>.
It is a good idea to cd into this folder and exploring it, when you have
a hard to track down-bug, so in this example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a90d91">cd</span> /tmp/nf/work/a3/0e2ea68c421ced4797e00de9e73155
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>ls -1a
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>-1a</code> flags, or in particular <code>-1tra</code> are very useful, and have the
following function:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-1</code> (the number) lists the files vertically instead of
horizontally, making it easier to read. If you also want more
details like timestamps and permissions, use <code>-l</code> (the letter)
instead.</li>
<li><code>-t</code> sorts the list by time</li>
<li><code>-r</code> reverses the the time-based sorting from <code>-t</code>, so that the last
files are located last (if the list is long, these will be the only
ones immediately visible on the screen)</li>
<li><code>-a</code> lists &ldquo;all&rdquo; files, meaning also hidden files, that is, those
starting with a <code>.</code> in the name.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the <code>-t</code> and <code>-r</code> flags are not strictly needed, we will skip them
below though for simplicity.</p>
<p>As you will see, the folder contains a number of hidden files, viewable
only with the <code>-a</code> flag to <code>ls</code>, that contain some key information on
how the job is being executed:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ ls -1a
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>..
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>.command.begin
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>.command.err
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>.command.log
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>.command.out
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>.command.run
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>.command.sh
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>.exitcode
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;some more files not relevant here&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>These files are very useful to acquaint yourself more with. Their
function is, in summary:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.command.begin</code></li>
<li><code>.command.err</code> - Everything written to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_error_%28stderr%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stderr</a>

from the command. Will typically be errors, but some commands are
ill-behaved and write out other stuff here as well, that might be
potentially useful for debugging.</li>
<li><code>.command.log</code> - Log output from the command</li>
<li><code>.command.out</code> - Everything written to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_output_%28stdout%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stdout</a>
</li>
<li><code>.command.run</code> - This is a scaffold script that contains various
bash functions to create temporary folder, stage files, execute the
.command.sh script, and clean up. We will look closer at it below.</li>
<li><code>.command.sh</code> - This script contains the main command run by the
task in question. It is thus very useful to check that it looks as
expected.</li>
<li><code>.exitcode</code> - This file will contain the exit code, or
&ldquo;returncode&rdquo; of the command. It is an integer value with various
meanings that can be looked up on the internet, but the most
important thing to know is that a 0 means the command has completed
successfully, and anything else (Typically 1 or above) means it has
failed in some way.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-debugging-a-command-in-the-work-folder">3. Debugging a command in the work folder</h4>
<p>If you have a tricky failing task that you don&rsquo;t really understand why
it fails, it might be a good idea to manually execute task scripts.</p>
<p>You will typically need to do that by executing the <code>.command.run</code>
script, which in turn executes <code>.command.sh</code>, since the former will
create the temporary directories, stage files etc that is needed for the
task to run properly.</p>
<p>So, you would do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>bash .command.run
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>&hellip; and watch for any detailed output that might give you hints.</p>
<h4 id="make-all-commands-visible-with-set--x">Make all commands visible with set -x</h4>
<p>The problem with the above is that the <code>.command.run</code> script does a lot
of &ldquo;magic&rdquo; and setup grunt work that you don&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>Thus, to make everything it does more clear, what you can do is to add
the commands <code>set -x</code> in the top of both the <code>.command.run</code> and
<code>.command.sh</code> scripts, using a text editor (the nano terminal based text
is available on most systems, and is more user-friendly than vim for new
users: <code>nano .command.run</code> &hellip; save with <code>Ctrl+W</code>, and exit with
<code>Ctrl+X</code>).</p>
<p>Then you can execute it again:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>bash .command.run
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>But even better is, if you pipe all the output to a file, so that you
can later read this at your own pace:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>bash .command.run &amp;&gt; out.log
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>(The <code>&amp;</code> in <code>&amp;&gt;</code> will make sure that both stdout and stderr are
redirected to the file)</p>
<p>Even better, is to BOTH redirect to a file, but also pipe it to
something like <code>less -S</code>, so you can see and scroll the output
immediately:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>bash .command.run |&amp; tee out.log | less -S
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here, the <code>|&amp;</code> will pipe both stderr and stdout to the next command,
which less <code>tee</code>, which will both take a filename where it writes its
output, and also forward the output to the next command, which is here
<code>less -S</code>.</p>
<h4 id="4-turning-off-the-cleanup-parts-to-explore-temporary-folders">4. Turning off the cleanup parts, to explore temporary folders</h4>
<p>One caveat when running the <code>.command.run</code> script is that it will always
clean up temporary folders after it is finished. This means certain
subtle errors might be harder to detect, since you can&rsquo;t explore these
temporary folders manually.</p>
<p>One way to get around this though is to comment out those parts in the
.command.run file before running it (In bash, you can comment it out by
adding a <code>#</code> - character at the beginning of the line).</p>
<p>In particular, check the <code>on_exit()</code> function, which might look like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>on_exit<span style="color:#000">()</span> <span style="color:#000">{</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#000">exit_status</span><span style="color:#000">=</span><span style="color:#c41a16">${</span><span style="color:#000">nxf_main_ret</span>:=<span style="color:#000">$?</span><span style="color:#c41a16">}</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#a90d91">printf</span> <span style="color:#000">$exit_status</span> &gt; /tmp/nf/work/a3/0e2ea68c421ced4797e00de9e73155/.exitcode
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#a90d91">set</span> +u
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#000">[[</span> <span style="color:#c41a16">&#34;</span><span style="color:#000">$tee1</span><span style="color:#c41a16">&#34;</span> <span style="color:#000">]]</span> <span style="color:#000">&amp;&amp;</span> <span style="color:#a90d91">kill</span> <span style="color:#000">$tee1</span> 2&gt;/dev/null
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#000">[[</span> <span style="color:#c41a16">&#34;</span><span style="color:#000">$tee2</span><span style="color:#c41a16">&#34;</span> <span style="color:#000">]]</span> <span style="color:#000">&amp;&amp;</span> <span style="color:#a90d91">kill</span> <span style="color:#000">$tee2</span> 2&gt;/dev/null
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#000">[[</span> <span style="color:#c41a16">&#34;</span><span style="color:#000">$ctmp</span><span style="color:#c41a16">&#34;</span> <span style="color:#000">]]</span> <span style="color:#000">&amp;&amp;</span> rm -rf <span style="color:#000">$ctmp</span> <span style="color:#000">||</span> <span style="color:#a90d91">true</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    rm -rf <span style="color:#000">$NXF_SCRATCH</span> <span style="color:#000">||</span> <span style="color:#a90d91">true</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    sync <span style="color:#000">||</span> <span style="color:#a90d91">true</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#a90d91">exit</span> <span style="color:#000">$exit_status</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#000">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here, you could comment our for example the
<code>rm -rf $NXF_SCRATCH || true</code> line, if you want the temporary folder to
remain existing (typically put in <code>/tmp</code> and named something like
<code>/tmp/nxf.XXXXXXXXX</code>. If you add <code>set -x</code> to the beginning of the script
as explained above, you should be able to see the exact path of this
one, when executing the command).</p>
<p>You can also have a look around the <code>nxf_main()</code> , and the
<code>nxf_launch()</code> functions. <code>nxf_main()</code> is located in the bottom of the
script and is the over-arching function, calling the other sub-functions
(the <code>on_exit()</code> is not explicitly called though, but is set up to be
called whenever the <code>nxf_main()</code> function is returning or interrupted),
while <code>nxf_launch()</code> is the one executing the .command.sh script,
together with some environment variables, setup for containers etc,
which is a somewhat common source of some errors.</p>
<p>Its content should be visible in the script output when you add <code>set -x</code>
to the script and run it, but it might also be good to examine it
manually!</p>
<p>If you want to be able to quickly enable these two adjustments when in a
work folder, you can add the following bash function to your
<code>~/.bash_aliases</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a90d91">function</span> debugnf<span style="color:#000">()</span> <span style="color:#000">{</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    sed -i <span style="color:#c41a16">&#39;2s/^/set -x\n/&#39;</span> .command.<span style="color:#000">{</span>run,sh<span style="color:#000">}</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    sed -i <span style="color:#c41a16">&#39;s/rm /#rm /g&#39;</span> .command.run;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#000">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then, when in a work folder, you can just run <code>debugnf</code> before running
any of the .command.run or .command.sh files manually.</p>
