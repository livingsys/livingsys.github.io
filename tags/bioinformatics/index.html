<h2><a href="/posts/learning-genomics-bioinformatics-in-2025/">Learning Genomics and Bioinformatics in 2025</a></h2>
<p>Bioinformatics is growing in the clinical field, and in my job in a clinical
microbiology lab, I&rsquo;m increasingly asked for tips about how to get into
bioinformatics or genomic data science.</p>
<p>As I recently took the plunge into genomics from my PhD field of small
molecular structures and machine learning, as part of getting into my current
position, I thought to write down what I learned in the process.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-tried">What I tried</h2>
<p>I actually tried for years to get into genomics, and tried quite a few things,
most of which failed.</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/bioinformatics-recipes/">We need recipes for common bioinformatics tasks</a></h2>
<p>Ad-hoc tasks in bioinformatics can contain such an immense number of operations
and tasks that need to be performed to achieve a certain goal. Often these are
all individually regarded as rather &ldquo;standard&rdquo; or &ldquo;routine&rdquo;. Despite this,
it is quite hard to find an authoritative set of &ldquo;recipes&rdquo; for how to do such
tasks.</p>
<p>Thus I was starting to think that there needs to be a collection of
bioinformatics &ldquo;recipes&rdquo;. A sort of &ldquo;cookbook&rdquo; for common
bioinformatics tasks.</p>

<p><p class="image">

</p>
</p>
<p>As we are - <a href="https://a16z.com/the-century-of-biology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to some expert
opinions</a>
 - living in the
Century of Biology, I found it interesting to reflect on Go&rsquo;s usage
within the field.</p>
<p>Go has some great features that make it really well suited for biology,
such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A relatively simple language that can be learned in a short time
even for people without a CS background. This is super important
aspect for biologists.</li>
<li>Fantastic support for cross-compilation into all major computer
architectures and operating systems, as static, self-sufficient
executables making it extremely simple to deploy tools, something
that can&rsquo;t be said about the currently most popular bio language,
Python.</li>
<li>Fantastic support for concurrency and writing code as a set of
parallell operations that streams data between them. Again, as
opposed to Python. More on that later.</li>
<li>A large standard library that contains a lot of common needs, even
for writing user interfaces and web servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Go has in fact garnered some use for bioinformatics tools over the years, with
some indications that its use is increasing. Examples of popular tools and
toolkits are <a href="https://github.com/shenwei356/seqkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SeqKit</a>
 (a veritable <em>swiss
army knife</em> for bioinformatics), the <a href="https://github.com/biogo/biogo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BioGo
toolkit</a>
, the <a href="https://github.com/pbenner/gonetics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gonetics
package</a>
 and lately the <a href="https://github.com/vertgenlab/gonomics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gonomics
package</a>
 and finally the
<a href="https://github.com/bebop/poly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poly</a>
 package for synthetic biology. And this
is besides heavy use in infrastructure-oriented projects like the
<a href="https://www.benthos.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benthos</a>
 stream processing tool, the <a href="https://github.com/grailbio/reflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reflow pipeline
tool</a>
 and <a href="https://pachyderm.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pachyderm orchestration

<p>I read this <a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent
article</a>

with practical recommendations on how to organize a computational project, in
terms of directory structure.</p>
<h2 id="directory-structure-matters">Directory structure matters</h2>
<p>The importance of a good directory structure seems to often be
overlooked in teaching about computational biology, but can be the
difference between a successful project, and one where every change or
re-run of some part of a workflow, will require days of manual fiddling
to get hand on the right data, in the right format, in the right place,
with the right version of the workflow, with the right parameters, and
then succeed to run it without errors.</p>

</p>
<p>It turned out I didn&rsquo;t have the time and strength to blog every day at
the NGS Bioinformatics Intro course, so here comes a wrap up with some
random notes and tidbits from the last days, including any concluding
remarks!</p>
<p>These days we started working on a more realistic NGS pipeline, on
analysing re-sequencing samples
(<a href="http://uppnex.se/twiki/pub/Courses/NgsIntro1502/Schedule/NGS_course_AJ_20150211.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slides</a>

).</p>
<h2 id="first-some-outcome-from-this-tutorial">First some outcome from this tutorial</h2>
<p>What do I mean with &ldquo;outcome&rdquo;? Well, as I tried to manually copy and
paste the <a href="http://uppnex.se/twiki/do/view/Courses/NgsIntro1502/ResequencingAnalysis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bag of hairy nasty long bash commandline strings in the
tutorial
pages</a>
,
that all depended upon each other, I got so frustrated that I decided to
try to encode them in a workflow language / tool.</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/ngs-bioinformatics-intro-course-day-2/">NGS Bioinformatics Intro Course Day 2</a></h2>
<p>Today was the second day of the <a href="http://uppnex.se/twiki/do/view/Courses/NgsIntro1502/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introductory course in NGS
bioinformatics</a>

that I&rsquo;m taking as part of my PhD studies.</p>
<p><p class="image">

</p>
</p>
<p>For me it started with a substantial oversleep, probably due to a
combination of an annoying cold and the ~2 hour commute from south
Stockholm to Uppsala and <a href="http://www.bmc.uu.se/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BMC</a>
. Thus I missed
some really interesting
<a href="http://uppnex.se/twiki/pub/Courses/NgsIntro1502/Schedule/dahlo-filetypes.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">material</a>

(and
<a href="http://uppnex.se/twiki/do/view/Courses/NgsIntro1502/FileTypes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tutorial</a>
)
on file types in NGS analysis, but will make sure to go through that in
my free time during the week.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s content was mostly introductions to the linux commandline in
general, and the <a href="http://www.uppmax.uu.se" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UPPMAX HPC environment</a>
 in
particular, an area I&rsquo;m already very familiar with, after two years as
a sysadmin at UPPMAX. Thus, today I mostly got to help out the other
students a bit.</p>
