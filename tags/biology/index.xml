      <description>I think Erlang/Elixir fits great as control plane or service-to-service messaging layer for distributing services built with flow-based programming&#xA;Just back from a one day visit to Erlang User Conference . I find the Erlang virtual machine fascinating. And with the new Elixir language built on top of it to fix some of the pain points with Erlang the language, the eco-system has got even more interesting.&#xA;What I find exciting about Erlang/Elixir and its virtual machine, is its ability to utilize multiple CPU:s on computers, and doing this across multiple computers, in what is commonly referred to as &amp;ldquo;distributed computing&amp;rdquo;.</description>
