      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m just back from the Applied Hologenomics Conference in 2024 (See also #AHC2024 on Twitter ) in Copenhagen and thought to reflect a little on the conference and highlight the bits that particularly stuck with me.&#xA;The first thing I want to say is that a paradigm shift is happening here.&#xA;I think what is happening here is a step away from the reductionist view of the past that goes beyond the systems biology approach that has been establishing itself during the last 10-20 years.</description>
