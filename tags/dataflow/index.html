<h2><a href="/posts/equation-centric-dataflow-programming-in-go/">Equation-centric dataflow programming in Go</a></h2>
Mathematical notation and dataflow programming Even though computations done on computers are very often based on some type of math, it is striking that the notation used in math to express equations and relations is not always very readily converted into programming code. Outside of purely symbolic programming …

<h2><a href="/posts/how-i-would-like-to-write-golang/">How I would like to write Go programs</a></h2>
 Some time ago I got a post published on GopherAcademy , outlining in detail how I think a flow-based programming inspired syntax can strongly help to create clearer, easier-to-maintain, and more declarative Go programs.
These ideas have since became clearer, and we (Ola Spjuth &rsquo;s research group at pharmbio ) …

<h2><a href="/posts/fbp-data-flow-syntax/">FBP inspired data flow syntax: The missing piece for the success of functional programming?</a></h2>
 Often when I suggest people have a look at Flow-based Programming (FBP) or Data Flow for one reason or another, people are often put off by the strong connection between these concepts and graphical programming. That is, the idea that programs will be easier to understand if expressed and developed in a visual …

<h2><a href="/posts/workflows-dataflow-not-task-deps/">Workflow tool makers: Allow defining data flow, not just task dependencies</a></h2>
Upsurge in workflow tools There seem to be a little upsurge in light-weight - often python-based - workflow tools for data pipelines in the last couple of years: Spotify&rsquo;s Luigi , OpenStack&rsquo;s Mistral , Pinterest&rsquo;s Pinball , and recently AirBnb&rsquo;s Airflow , to name a few. These are all interesting …
