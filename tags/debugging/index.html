    <h2><a href="/posts/debugging-inside-jinja-templates-using-pdb-ipdb/">Debugging inside Jinja templates using pdb/ipdb</a></h2>
    I&rsquo;m working on a static reporting tool using the Jinja2 templating engine for Python.
I was trying to figure out a way to enter into the Jinja templating code with the pdb/ipdb commandline debugger.
I tried creating an .ipdbrc file in my local directory with the line:
path/to/template.html:&lt;lineno&gt; &hellip; but that didn&rsquo;t work.
What worked was to figure out the line that says :
return self.environment.concat(self.root_render_func(ctx)) &hellip; inside the the jinja codebase, and put a breakpoint on that (which for me was on line 1299, but might vary depending on version):
  
    
    <h2><a href="/posts/troubleshooting-nextflow-pipelines/">Troubleshooting Nextflow pipelines</a></h2>
    We have been evaluating Nextflow before in my work at pharmb.io , but that was before DSL2 and the support for re-usable modules (which was one reason we needed to develop our own tools to support our challenges, as explained in the paper ). Thus, there&rsquo;s definitely some stuff to get into.
Based on my years in bioinformatics and data science, I&rsquo;ve seen that the number one skill that you need to develop is to be able to effectively troubleshoot things, because things will invariably fail in all kinds of ways.
