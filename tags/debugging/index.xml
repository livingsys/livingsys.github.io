      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on a static reporting tool using the Jinja2 templating engine for Python.&#xA;I was trying to figure out a way to enter into the Jinja templating code with the pdb/ipdb commandline debugger.&#xA;I tried creating an .ipdbrc file in my local directory with the line:&#xA;path/to/template.html:&amp;lt;lineno&amp;gt; &amp;hellip; but that didn&amp;rsquo;t work.&#xA;What worked was to figure out the line that says :&#xA;return self.environment.concat(self.root_render_func(ctx)) &amp;hellip; inside the the jinja codebase, and put a breakpoint on that (which for me was on line 1299, but might vary depending on version):</description>

      <description>We have been evaluating Nextflow before in my work at pharmb.io , but that was before DSL2 and the support for re-usable modules (which was one reason we needed to develop our own tools to support our challenges, as explained in the paper ). Thus, there&amp;rsquo;s definitely some stuff to get into.&#xA;Based on my years in bioinformatics and data science, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that the number one skill that you need to develop is to be able to effectively troubleshoot things, because things will invariably fail in all kinds of ways.</description>
