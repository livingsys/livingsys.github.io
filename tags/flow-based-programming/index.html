<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>An area where I&rsquo;m not so happy with some things I&rsquo;ve seen in FP, is
composability.</p>
<p>In my view, a well designed system or langauge should make functions (or
other smallest unit of computation) more easily composable, not less.</p>
<p>What strikes me as one of the biggest elephants in the room regarding
FP, is that typical functions compose fantastically as long as you are
working with a single input argument, and a single output for each
function application, but as soon as you start taking multiple input
arguments and returned outputs though, you tend to end up with very
messy trees of function application. Even handy techniques such as
currying tend to get overly complex if you want to handle all the
possible downstream dataflow paths in a structured way.</p>

<p>I was so happy the other day to find someone else who found the great
benefits of a little pattern for how to structure pipeline-heavy
programs in Go, which I described in a few posts before. I have been
surprised to not find more people using this kind of pattern, which has
been so extremely helpful to us, so I thought to take this opportunity
to re-iterate it again, in the hopes that more people might get aware of
it.</p>

<p>Some time ago I got a <a href="http://blog.gopheracademy.com/composable-pipelines-pattern" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post published on
GopherAcademy</a>
,
outlining in detail how I think a <a href="http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flow-based
programming</a>
 inspired syntax can
strongly help to create clearer, easier-to-maintain, and more
declarative Go programs.</p>
<p>These ideas have since became clearer, and we (<a href="http://twitter.com/ola_spjuth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ola
Spjuth</a>
&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.farmbio.uu.se/research/researchgroups/pb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research group at
pharmbio</a>
) have
successfully used them to make the workflow syntax for

 (Spotify&rsquo;s great workflow
engine by <a href="http://twitter.com/fulhack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erik Bernhardsson</a>
 &amp; co)
workflows easier, as implemented in the <a href="https://github.com/samuell/sciluigi#readme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SciLuigi helper

<p><p class="image">

</p>
</p>
<p>Often when I suggest people have a look at <a href="http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flow-based
Programming</a>
 (FBP) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data
Flow</a>
 for one reason or another,
people are often put off by the strong connection between these concepts
and graphical programming. That is, the idea that programs will be
easier to understand if expressed and developed in a visual notation.</p>
<p>This is unfortunate, since I think this is in no way the core benefit of
FBP or Data Flow, although it is a nice side-effect for those who prefer
it. For example, I personally mostly prefer working with text over a
graphical notation, for productivity reasons.</p>

Just
back from a one day visit to <a href="http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2015" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erlang User
Conference</a>
. I find the
<a href="http://www.erlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erlang</a>
 virtual machine fascinating. And with
the new <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elixir language</a>
 built on top of it to
fix some of the pain points with <em>Erlang the language</em>, the eco-system
has got even more interesting.</p>
<p>What I find exciting about Erlang/Elixir and its virtual machine, is its
ability to utilize multiple CPU:s on computers, and doing this across
multiple computers, in what is commonly referred to as &ldquo;distributed
computing&rdquo;. <p class="image">

There
seem to be a little upsurge in light-weight - often python-based -
workflow tools for data pipelines in the last couple of years:
Spotify&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/spotify/luigi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luigi</a>
, OpenStack&rsquo;s
<a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Mistral" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mistral</a>
, Pinterest&rsquo;s
<a href="https://github.com/pinterest/pinball" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pinball</a>
, and recently AirBnb&rsquo;s
<a href="https://github.com/airbnb/airflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airflow</a>
, to name a few. These are
all interesting tools, and it is an interesting trend for us at
<a href="http://www.farmbio.uu.se/research/researchgroups/pb/?languageId=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pharmbio</a>
,
who try to see how we can use workflow tools to automate bio- and
cheminformatics tasks on compute clusters.</p>

<p>In trying to get my head around the code of the very interesting
<a href="https://github.com/trustmaster/goflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoFlow</a>
 library, (for flow-based
programming in Go), and the accompanying <a href="https://github.com/samuell/blow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flow-based bioinformatics

 I started hacking on, I needed
to get some kind of visualization (like a call graph) &hellip; something
like this:</p>

<p>I then found out about the go tool pprof command, for which the Go team
published a <a href="http://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>
