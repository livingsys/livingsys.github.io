    <h2><a href="/posts/fbp-data-flow-syntax/">FBP inspired data flow syntax: The missing piece for the success of functional programming?</a></h2>
    Often when I suggest people have a look at Flow-based Programming (FBP) or Data Flow for one reason or another, people are often put off by the strong connection between these concepts and graphical programming. That is, the idea that programs will be easier to understand if expressed and developed in a visual notation.
This is unfortunate, since I think this is in no way the core benefit of FBP or Data Flow, although it is a nice side-effect for those who prefer it.

    Upsurge in workflow tools There seem to be a little upsurge in light-weight - often python-based - workflow tools for data pipelines in the last couple of years: Spotify&rsquo;s Luigi , OpenStack&rsquo;s Mistral , Pinterest&rsquo;s Pinball , and recently AirBnb&rsquo;s Airflow , to name a few. These are all interesting tools, and it is an interesting trend for us at pharmbio , who try to see how we can use workflow tools to automate bio- and cheminformatics tasks on compute clusters.
