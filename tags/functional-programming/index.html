<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>An area where I&rsquo;m not so happy with some things I&rsquo;ve seen in FP, is
composability.</p>
<p>In my view, a well designed system or langauge should make functions (or
other smallest unit of computation) more easily composable, not less.</p>
<p>What strikes me as one of the biggest elephants in the room regarding
FP, is that typical functions compose fantastically as long as you are
working with a single input argument, and a single output for each
function application, but as soon as you start taking multiple input
arguments and returned outputs though, you tend to end up with very
messy trees of function application. Even handy techniques such as
currying tend to get overly complex if you want to handle all the
possible downstream dataflow paths in a structured way.</p>

<p>Often when I suggest people have a look at <a href="http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flow-based
Programming</a>
 (FBP) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data
Flow</a>
 for one reason or another,
people are often put off by the strong connection between these concepts
and graphical programming. That is, the idea that programs will be
easier to understand if expressed and developed in a visual notation.</p>
<p>This is unfortunate, since I think this is in no way the core benefit of
FBP or Data Flow, although it is a nice side-effect for those who prefer
it. For example, I personally mostly prefer working with text over a
graphical notation, for productivity reasons.</p>
