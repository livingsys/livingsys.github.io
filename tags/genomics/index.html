    <h2><a href="/posts/ngs-bioinformatics-intro-course-day-3/">NGS Bioinformatics Course Day 3: New Luigi helper tool, &#34;real-world&#34; NGS pipelines</a></h2>
    It turned out I didn&rsquo;t have the time and strength to blog every day at the NGS Bioinformatics Intro course, so here comes a wrap up with some random notes and tidbits from the last days, including any concluding remarks!
These days we started working on a more realistic NGS pipeline, on analysing re-sequencing samples (slides , tutorial ).
First some outcome from this tutorial What do I mean with &ldquo;outcome&rdquo;?

    <h2><a href="/posts/ngs-bioinformatics-intro-course-day-2/">NGS Bioinformatics Intro Course Day 2</a></h2>
    Today was the second day of the introductory course in NGS bioinformatics that I&rsquo;m taking as part of my PhD studies.
For me it started with a substantial oversleep, probably due to a combination of an annoying cold and the ~2 hour commute from south Stockholm to Uppsala and BMC . Thus I missed some really interesting material (and tutorial ) on file types in NGS analysis, but will make sure to go through that in my free time during the week.

    Just finished day 1 of the introductory course on Bioinformatics for Next generation sequencing data at Scilifelab Uppsala. Attaching a photo from one of the hands-on tutorial sessions, with the tutorial leaders, standing to the right.
Today&rsquo;s content was mostly introductions to the linux commandline in general, and the UPPMAX HPC environment in particular, an area I&rsquo;m already very familiar with, after two years as a sysadmin at UPPMAX. Thus, today I mostly got to help out the other students a bit.
