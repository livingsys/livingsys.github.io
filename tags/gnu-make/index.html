    <h2><a href="/posts/the-problem-with-make-for-scientific-workflows/">The problem with make for scientific workflows</a></h2>
    The workflow problem solved once and for all in 1979? As soon as the topic of scientific workflows is brought up, there are always a few make fans fervently insisting that the problem of workflows is solved once and for all with GNU make , written first in the 70&rsquo;s :)
Personally I haven&rsquo;t been so sure. On the one hand, I know the tool solves a lot of problems for many people.
