<h2><a href="/posts/rewrite-of-scicommander-in-go/">Rewrite of Scicommander in Go with much improved algorithm</a></h2>
<p>When I presented a poster about
<a href="https://github.com/samuell/scicommander" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SciCommander</a>
 at the <a href="https://livesys.se/posts/scicommander-0.3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swedish bioinformatics workshop</a>
 last year,
I got a lot of awesome feedback from some great people including Fredrik
Boulund, Johannes Alneberg and others, of which I unfortunately lost the names
(please shout out if you read this!).</p>
<p>(For those new to SciCommander, it is my attempt at creating a tool that can
track complete provenance reports also for ad-hoc shell commands, not just
those included in a pipeline. The grand plan is also to integrate this
provenance tracking with those of popular pipelines, to enable seamless
provenance report generation across pipelines and ad-hoc commands).</p>

<p><p class="image">
    <img src="gopherbinfie.jpg" alt="A gopher doing

</p>
</p>
<p>As we are - <a href="https://a16z.com/the-century-of-biology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to some expert
opinions</a>
 - living in the
Century of Biology, I found it interesting to reflect on Go&rsquo;s usage
within the field.</p>
<p>Go has some great features that make it really well suited for biology,
such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A relatively simple language that can be learned in a short time
even for people without a CS background. This is super important
aspect for biologists.</li>
<li>Fantastic support for cross-compilation into all major computer
architectures and operating systems, as static, self-sufficient
executables making it extremely simple to deploy tools, something
that can&rsquo;t be said about the currently most popular bio language,
Python.</li>
<li>Fantastic support for concurrency and writing code as a set of
parallell operations that streams data between them. Again, as
opposed to Python. More on that later.</li>
<li>A large standard library that contains a lot of common needs, even
for writing user interfaces and web servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Go has in fact garnered some use for bioinformatics tools over the years, with
some indications that its use is increasing. Examples of popular tools and
toolkits are <a href="https://github.com/shenwei356/seqkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SeqKit</a>
 (a veritable <em>swiss
army knife</em> for bioinformatics), the <a href="https://github.com/biogo/biogo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BioGo
toolkit</a>
, the <a href="https://github.com/pbenner/gonetics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gonetics
package</a>
 and lately the <a href="https://github.com/vertgenlab/gonomics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gonomics
package</a>
 and finally the
<a href="https://github.com/bebop/poly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poly</a>
 package for synthetic biology. And this
is besides heavy use in infrastructure-oriented projects like the
<a href="https://www.benthos.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benthos</a>
 stream processing tool, the <a href="https://github.com/grailbio/reflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reflow pipeline

<h2><a href="/posts/crystal-concurrency-easier-syntax-than-golang/">Crystal: Go-like concurrency with easier syntax</a></h2>
<p>I have been playing around a lot with concurrency in Go over the years,
resulting in libraries such as <a href="https://scipipe.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SciPipe</a>
,
<a href="http://flowbase.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FlowBase</a>
 and
<a href="https://github.com/rdfio/rdf2smw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rdf2smw</a>
. My main motivation for
looking into Go has been the possibility to use it as a more performant,
scaleable and type-safe alternative to Python for data heavy scripting
tasks in bioinformatics and other fields I&rsquo;ve been dabbling in.
Especially as it makes it so easy to write concurrent and parallel code
in it. Be warned that this context is surely giving me some biases.</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/go-test-coverage-in-browser/">Viewing Go test coverage in the browser with one command</a></h2>
<p>Go has some really nice tools for running tests and analyzing code. One
of these functionalities is that you can generate coverage information
when running tests, that can later be viewed in a browser using the
<code>go tool cover</code> command. It turns out though, since doing it requires
executing multiple commands after each other, it might be hard to
remember the exact commands.</p>
<p>To this end, I created a bash alias that does everything in one command,
<code>gocov</code>. It looks like this (to be placed in your <code>~/.bash_aliases</code> file

<p>I was so happy the other day to find someone else who found the great
benefits of a little pattern for how to structure pipeline-heavy
programs in Go, which I described in a few posts before. I have been
surprised to not find more people using this kind of pattern, which has
been so extremely helpful to us, so I thought to take this opportunity
to re-iterate it again, in the hopes that more people might get aware of
it.</p>

&rdquo;. There is probably
still some other uses of this approach though, as the XML version of DrugBank
seems to contain a lot more information in a single format. And in any case,
this forced me to figure out how to parse large XML files in a streaming
fashion in Go, as older tools like
<a href="http://xmlstar.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XMLStarlet</a>
 chokes for many minutes upon the
DrugBank file (trying to read it all into memory?), killing any attempt at an
iterative development cycle. And, it turns out Go&rsquo;s support for streaming XML
parsing is just great!</p>

</ul>
<p>It is interesting to note how Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go programming

 seems to increase in popularity in
bioinformatics.</p>
<p>Just to give a sample of some of the Go based bioinformatics tools I&rsquo;ve
stumbled upon, there is since a few years back, the <a href="https://github.com/biogo/biogo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biogo
library</a>
, providing common functionality
for bioinformatics tasks. It was recently reviewed in two great blog
posts (<a href="https://medium.com/@boti_ka/a-gentle-introduction-to-b%C3%ADogo-part-i-65dbd40e31d4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part

).
Further, Brent Pedersen also wrote a little collection of Go based
bioinfo tools, compiled down into a single static binary, called
<a href="https://github.com/brentp/goleft" target="_blank" rel="noopener">goleft</a>
, and finally, I there is the
<a href="https://github.com/exascience/elprep" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elprep tool</a>
, used to prepare
.sam/.bam/.cram files for variant calling, which was published in a

<h2><a href="/posts/profiling-and-call-graphs-for-golang/">Profiling and creating call graphs for Go programs</a></h2>
<p>In trying to get my head around the code of the very interesting
<a href="https://github.com/trustmaster/goflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoFlow</a>
 library, (for flow-based
programming in Go), and the accompanying <a href="https://github.com/samuell/blow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flow-based bioinformatics
library</a>
 I started hacking on, I needed
to get some kind of visualization (like a call graph) &hellip; something
like this:</p>
<p><p class="image">
    <img src="basecompl_blow_callgraph_1.png" alt="Call graph"  />
</p>
</p>
<p>(And in the end, that is what I got &hellip; read on &hellip; ) :)</p>
<p>I then found out about the go tool pprof command, for which the Go team
published a <a href="http://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>
 on
<a href="http://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>
