 As we are - according to some expert opinions - living in the Century of Biology, I found it interesting to reflect on Go&rsquo;s usage within the field.
Go has some great features that make it really well suited for biology, such as:
A relatively simple language that can be learned in a short time even for people …

I have been playing around a lot with concurrency in Go over the years, resulting in libraries such as SciPipe , FlowBase and rdf2smw .

It turns out though, since doing it requires executing multiple commands after each …

 TL;DR: We wrote a post on gopherdata.io, about the growing ecosystem of Go-based workflow tools in bioinformatics. Go read it here It is interesting to note how Google&rsquo;s Go programming language seems to increase in popularity in bioinformatics.

<h2><a href="/posts/range-over-multiple-go-channels/">(Almost) ranging over multiple Go channels simultaneously</a></h2>
 Thus, optimally, one would want to use Go&rsquo;s handy range keyword for looping over multiple channels, since range takes care of closing the for-loop at the right time (when the inbound channel is closed). So something like this (N.B: non-working code!):
for a, b, c := range chA, chB, chC { doSomething(a, b, c) } …
