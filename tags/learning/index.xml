      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m reading A mind for numbers , by Barbara Oakley. Firstly, it is a very interesting book, but the main lesson I&amp;rsquo;ve already learned from this book seems so paramount that I have to write it down, so I don&amp;rsquo;t forget it (some meta-connotations in that statement ;) ). I found the book through Barbara&amp;rsquo;s coursera course &amp;ldquo;Learning how to Learn &amp;rdquo;, and to me it seems learning in general is the topic of the book too, more than numbers specifically - but I still have to read it through, so stay tuned.</description>
