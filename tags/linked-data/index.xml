      <description>This is an excerpt from the &amp;ldquo;future outlook&amp;rdquo; section of my thesis titled &amp;ldquo;Reproducible Data Analysis in Drug Discovery with Scientific Workflows and the Semantic Web&amp;rdquo; (click for the open access full text), which aims to provide various putative ways towards improved reproducibility, understandability and verifiability of computer-aided research.&#xA;Historically, something of a divide has developed between the metadata rich datasets and approaches in the world of Semantic Web/Ontologies/Linked Data, versus in the Big Data field in particular, which has been at least initially mostly focused on large unstructured datasets.</description>

      <description>During the last months, I have had the pleasure work together with Matthias Palmér (MetaSolutions AB ) and Fernanda Dórea (National Veterinary Institute ), to prepare for and organize this year&amp;rsquo;s version of the annual Linked Data Sweden event , which this year was held in Uppsala hosted by the SciLifeLab Data Centre .&#xA;Thanks to engaged speakers and attendees, it turned into an interesting day with great discussions, new contacts, and a lot of new impressions and insights.</description>
