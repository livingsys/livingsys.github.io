<h2><a href="/posts/troubleshooting-nextflow-pipelines/">Troubleshooting Nextflow pipelines</a></h2>
We have been evaluating Nextflow before in my work at pharmb.io , but that was before DSL2 and the support for re-usable modules (which was one reason we needed to develop our own tools to support our challenges, as explained in the paper ). Thus, there&rsquo;s definitely some stuff to get into.
Based on my years in bioinformatics and data science, I&rsquo;ve seen that the number one skill that you need to develop is to be able to effectively troubleshoot things, because things will invariably fail in all kinds of ways.

<h2><a href="/posts/first-production-workflow-run-with-scipipe/">First production run with SciPipe - A Go-based scientific workflow tool</a></h2>
Today marked the day when we ran the very first production workflow with SciPipe , the Go -based scientific workflow tool we&rsquo;ve been working on over the last couple of years. Yay! :)
This is how it looked (no fancy GUI or such yet, sorry):
The first result we got in this very very first job was a list of counts of ligands (chemical compounds) in the ExcapeDB dataset (download here ) interacting with the 44 protein/gene targets identified by Bowes et al as a good baseline set for identifying hazardous side-effects effects in the body (that is, any chemical compounds binding these proteins, will never become an approved drug).
