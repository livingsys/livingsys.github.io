    We have been evaluating Nextflow before in my work at pharmb.io , but that was before DSL2 and the support for re-usable modules (which was one reason we needed to develop our own tools to support our challenges, as explained in the paper ). Thus, there&rsquo;s definitely some stuff to get into.
Based on my years in bioinformatics and data science, I&rsquo;ve seen that the number one skill that you need to develop is to be able to effectively troubleshoot things, because things will invariably fail in all kinds of ways.
