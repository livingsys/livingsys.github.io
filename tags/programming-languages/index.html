<h2><a href="/posts/golang-for-bioinformatics/">Why didn&#39;t Go get a breakthrough in bioinformatics (yet)?</a></h2>
<p><p class="image">

</p>
</p>
<p>As we are - <a href="https://a16z.com/the-century-of-biology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to some expert
opinions</a>
 - living in the
Century of Biology, I found it interesting to reflect on Go&rsquo;s usage
within the field.</p>
<p>Go has some great features that make it really well suited for biology,
such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A relatively simple language that can be learned in a short time
even for people without a CS background. This is super important
aspect for biologists.</li>
<li>Fantastic support for cross-compilation into all major computer
architectures and operating systems, as static, self-sufficient
executables making it extremely simple to deploy tools, something
that can&rsquo;t be said about the currently most popular bio language,
Python.</li>
<li>Fantastic support for concurrency and writing code as a set of
parallell operations that streams data between them. Again, as
opposed to Python. More on that later.</li>
<li>A large standard library that contains a lot of common needs, even
for writing user interfaces and web servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Go has in fact garnered some use for bioinformatics tools over the years, with
some indications that its use is increasing. Examples of popular tools and
toolkits are <a href="https://github.com/shenwei356/seqkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SeqKit</a>
 (a veritable <em>swiss
army knife</em> for bioinformatics), the <a href="https://github.com/biogo/biogo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BioGo
toolkit</a>
, the <a href="https://github.com/pbenner/gonetics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gonetics
package</a>
 and lately the <a href="https://github.com/vertgenlab/gonomics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gonomics
package</a>
 and finally the
<a href="https://github.com/bebop/poly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poly</a>
 package for synthetic biology. And this
is besides heavy use in infrastructure-oriented projects like the
<a href="https://www.benthos.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benthos</a>
 stream processing tool, the <a href="https://github.com/grailbio/reflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reflow pipeline
tool</a>
 and <a href="https://pachyderm.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pachyderm orchestration
suite</a>
.</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/golang-growing-in-bioinformatics-workflows/">Go is growing in bioinformatics workflow tools</a></h2>
<p><p class="image">
    <img src="gopher_thinking_workflows.png" alt="Gopher thinking with logos of different workflow tools in the air"  />
</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TL;DR: We wrote a post on gopherdata.io, about the growing ecosystem of
Go-based workflow tools in bioinformatics. <a href="https://gopherdata.io/post/more_go_based_workflow_tools_in_bioinformatics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go read it
here</a>
</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It is interesting to note how Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go programming
language</a>
 seems to increase in popularity in
bioinformatics.</p>
<p>Just to give a sample of some of the Go based bioinformatics tools I&rsquo;ve
stumbled upon, there is since a few years back, the <a href="https://github.com/biogo/biogo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biogo
library</a>
, providing common functionality
for bioinformatics tasks. It was recently reviewed in two great blog
posts (<a href="https://medium.com/@boti_ka/a-gentle-introduction-to-b%C3%ADogo-part-i-65dbd40e31d4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part
I</a>
,
<a href="https://medium.com/@boti_ka/a-gentle-introduction-to-b%C3%ADogo-part-ii-1f0df1cf72f0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part
II</a>
).
Further, Brent Pedersen also wrote a little collection of Go based
bioinfo tools, compiled down into a single static binary, called
<a href="https://github.com/brentp/goleft" target="_blank" rel="noopener">goleft</a>
, and finally, I there is the
<a href="https://github.com/exascience/elprep" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elprep tool</a>
, used to prepare
.sam/.bam/.cram files for variant calling, which was published in a
<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0132868" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PLoS one
paper</a>
.
Just a few examples.</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/the-best-of-go-d-and-rust/">Combining the best of Go, D and Rust?</a></h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ve been following the development of <a href="http://dlang.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D</a>
,
<a href="http://golang.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go</a>
 and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rust</a>
 (and also
<a href="http://www.freepascal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FreePascal</a>
 for <a href="https://github.com/NBISweden/mdc-file-export" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some use
cases</a>
) for some years
(<a href="http://saml.rilspace.org/moar-languagez-gc-content-in-python-d-fpc-c-and-c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been into some benchmarking for bioinfo
tasks</a>
),
and now we finally have three (four, with fpc) stable statically
compiled languages with some momentum behind them, meaning they all are
past 1.0.</p>
<p>While I have went with Go for <a href="http://scipipe.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current projects</a>
, I
still have a hard time &ldquo;totally falling in love&rdquo; with any single of
these languages. They all fulfill different subsets of my wishlist for
an optimal compiled data munging language.</p>
