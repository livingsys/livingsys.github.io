      <description>When I presented a poster about SciCommander at the Swedish bioinformatics workshop last year, I got a lot of awesome feedback from some great people including Fredrik Boulund, Johannes Alneberg and others, of which I unfortunately lost the names (please shout out if you read this!).&#xA;For those new to SciCommander, it is my attempt at creating a tool that can track complete provenance reports also for ad-hoc shell commands, not just those included in a pipeline.</description>

      <title>On Provenance Reports in Scientific Workflows</title>

      <description>One of the more important tasks for a scientific workflow is to keep track of so called &amp;ldquo;provenance information&amp;rdquo; about its data outputs - information about how each data file was created. This is important so other researchers can easily replicate the study (re-run it with the same software and tools). It should also help for anyone wanting to reproduce it (re-run the same study design, possibly with other software and tools).</description>
