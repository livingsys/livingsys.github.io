      <description>One of the more important tasks for a scientific workflow is to keep track of so called &amp;ldquo;provenance information&amp;rdquo; about its data outputs - information about how each data file was created. This is important so other researchers can easily replicate the study (re-run it with the same software and tools). It should also help for anyone wanting to reproduce it (re-run the same study design, possibly with other software and tools).</description>
