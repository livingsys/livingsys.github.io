    <h2><a href="/posts/debugging-inside-jinja-templates-using-pdb-ipdb/">Debugging inside Jinja templates using pdb/ipdb</a></h2>
    I&rsquo;m working on a static reporting tool using the Jinja2 templating engine for Python.
I was trying to figure out a way to enter into the Jinja templating code with the pdb/ipdb commandline debugger.
I tried creating an .ipdbrc file in my local directory with the line:
path/to/template.html:&lt;lineno&gt; &hellip; but that didn&rsquo;t work.
What worked was to figure out the line that says :
return self.environment.concat(self.root_render_func(ctx)) &hellip; inside the the jinja codebase, and put a breakpoint on that (which for me was on line 1299, but might vary depending on version):
  
    
    <h2><a href="/posts/pub-sub-with-zeromq-in-python/">Basic PUB/SUB connection with ZeroMQ in Python</a></h2>
    ZeroMQ is a great way to quickly and simply send messages between multiple programs running on the same or different computers. It is very simple and robust since it doesn&rsquo;t need any central server. Instead it talks directly between the programs through sockets, TCP-connections or similar.
ZeroMQ has client libraries for basically all commonly used programming languages, but when testing out that a connection works between e.g. two different machines, it might be good to keep things simple and test just the connection, as simply as possible.

    <h2><a href="/posts/the-unexpected-usefullness-of-json-on-the-commandline/">The unexpected convenience of JSON on the commandline</a></h2>
    I was working with a migration from drupal to processwire CMS:es, where I wanted to be able to pipe data, including the body field with HTML formatting and all, through multiple processing steps in a flexible manner. I&rsquo;d start with an extraction SQL query, through a few components to replace and massage the data, and finally over to an import command using processwire&rsquo;s wireshell tool . So, basically I needed a flexible format for structured data that could be sent as one &ldquo;data object&rdquo; per line, to work nicely with linux commandline tools like grep, sed and awk.
  
    
    <h2><a href="/posts/how-to-compile-vim-for-use-with-pyenv-and-vim-pyenv/">How to compile vim for use with pyenv and vim-pyenv</a></h2>
    This manifested itself in a bunch of error message from the python module in vim, ending with:
AttributeError: &#39;module&#39; object has no attribute &#39;vars&#39; I first thought it was an error in vim-pyenv and reported it (see that issue for more in-depth details). In summary it turns out that older versions of VIM indeed lack some attributes in its python module, so I figured I had to compile my own version, below are just my notes about how to do this, for future reference:
