<h2><a href="/posts/rewrite-of-scicommander-in-go/">Rewrite of Scicommander in Go with much improved algorithm</a></h2>
<p>When I presented a poster about
<a href="https://github.com/samuell/scicommander" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SciCommander</a>
 at the <a href="https://livesys.se/posts/scicommander-0.3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swedish bioinformatics workshop</a>
 last year,
I got a lot of awesome feedback from some great people including Fredrik
Boulund, Johannes Alneberg and others, of which I unfortunately lost the names
(please shout out if you read this!).</p>
<p>(For those new to SciCommander, it is my attempt at creating a tool that can
track complete provenance reports also for ad-hoc shell commands, not just
those included in a pipeline. The grand plan is also to integrate this
provenance tracking with those of popular pipelines, to enable seamless
provenance report generation across pipelines and ad-hoc commands).</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/scicommander-0.3/">SciCommander - track provenance of any shell command</a></h2>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t written much about a new tool I&rsquo;ve been working on in some
extra time: <a href="https://github.com/samuell/scicommander" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SciCommander</a>
.</p>
<p>I just presented a poster about it at the <a href="https://sbw2023.nu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swedish Bioinformatics
Workshop 2023</a>
 , so perhaps let me first present you
the poster instead of re-iterating what it is (click to view large

<h3 id="new-version-not-requiring-running-the-scicmd-command">New version not requiring running the scicmd command</h3>
<p>I got a lot of great feedback from numerous people at the conference,
most of who pointed out that it would be great if one could start
scicommander as a kind of subshell, inside which one can run commands as
usual, instead of running them via the <code>scicmd -c</code> command.</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/linked-data-science/">Linked Data Science - For improved understandability of computer-aided research</a></h2>
<p><em>This is an excerpt from the &ldquo;future outlook&rdquo; section of my thesis
titled <a href="http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1242336&amp;dswid=2522" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&ldquo;Reproducible Data Analysis in Drug Discovery with Scientific

<p>Historically, something of a divide has developed between the metadata
rich datasets and approaches in the world of Semantic
Web/Ontologies/Linked Data, versus in the Big Data field in particular,
which has been at least initially mostly focused on large unstructured
datasets.</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/todournal/">To make computational lab note-taking happen, make the journal into a todo-list (a &#34;Todournal&#34;)</a></h2>
<h2 id="good-lab-note-taking-is-hard">Good lab note-taking is hard</h2>
<p>Good note-taking is in my opinion as important for computational
research as for wet lab research. For computational research it is much
easier though to forget doing it, since you might not have a physical
notebook lying on your desk staring at you, but rather might need to
open a specific software or file, to write the notes. I think this is
one reason why lab note taking seems to happen a lot less among
computational scientists than among wet lab ditto.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of the more important tasks for a scientific workflow is to keep
track of so called &ldquo;provenance information&rdquo; about its data outputs -
information about how each data file was created. This is important so
other researchers can easily replicate the study (re-run it with the
same software and tools). It should also help for anyone wanting to
reproduce it (re-run the same study design, possibly with other software
and tools).</p>

<h2 id="the-workflow-problem-solved-once-and-for-all-in-1979">The workflow problem solved once and for all in 1979?</h2>
<p>As soon as the topic of scientific workflows is brought up, there are
always a few make fans fervently insisting that the problem of workflows
is solved once and for all with <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GNU
make</a>
, written first in the 70&rsquo;s :)</p>
<p>Personally I haven&rsquo;t been so sure. On the one hand, I know the tool
solves a lot of problems for many people. Also, there is something very
attractive about buildling on a tool that you can be sure will be
available on more or less every unix-like operating system, for decades
to come.</p>
