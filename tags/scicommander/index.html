    <h2><a href="/posts/scicommander-0.3/">SciCommander - track provenance of any shell command</a></h2>

New version not requiring running the scicmd command I got a lot of great feedback from numerous people at the conference, most of who pointed out that it would be great if one could start scicommander as a kind of subshell, inside which one can run commands as usual, instead of running them via the scicmd -c command.
