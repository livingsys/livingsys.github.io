<h2><a href="/posts/rewrite-of-scicommander-in-go/">Rewrite of Scicommander in Go with much improved algorithm</a></h2>
When I presented a poster about SciCommander at the Swedish bioinformatics workshop last year, I got a lot of awesome feedback from some great people including Fredrik Boulund, Johannes Alneberg and others, of which I unfortunately lost the names (please shout out if you read this!).
(For those new to SciCommander, it is my attempt at creating a tool that can track complete provenance reports also for ad-hoc shell commands, not just those included in a pipeline.

<h2><a href="/posts/scicommander-0.3/">SciCommander - track provenance of any shell command</a></h2>
I haven&rsquo;t written much about a new tool I&rsquo;ve been working on in some extra time: SciCommander .
I just presented a poster about it at the Swedish Bioinformatics Workshop 2023 , so perhaps let me first present you the poster instead of re-iterating what it is (click to view large version):
New version not requiring running the scicmd command I got a lot of great feedback from numerous people at the conference, most of who pointed out that it would be great if one could start scicommander as a kind of subshell, inside which one can run commands as usual, instead of running them via the scicmd -c command.
