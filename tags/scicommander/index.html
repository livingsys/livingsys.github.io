<h2><a href="/posts/rewrite-of-scicommander-in-go/">Rewrite of Scicommander in Go with much improved algorithm</a></h2>
<p>When I presented a poster about
<a href="https://github.com/samuell/scicommander" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SciCommander</a>
 at the <a href="https://livesys.se/posts/scicommander-0.3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swedish bioinformatics workshop</a>
 last year,
I got a lot of awesome feedback from some great people including Fredrik
Boulund, Johannes Alneberg and others, of which I unfortunately lost the names
(please shout out if you read this!).</p>
<p>(For those new to SciCommander, it is my attempt at creating a tool that can
track complete provenance reports also for ad-hoc shell commands, not just
those included in a pipeline. The grand plan is also to integrate this
provenance tracking with those of popular pipelines, to enable seamless
provenance report generation across pipelines and ad-hoc commands).</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/scicommander-0.3/">SciCommander - track provenance of any shell command</a></h2>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t written much about a new tool I&rsquo;ve been working on in some
extra time: <a href="https://github.com/samuell/scicommander" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SciCommander</a>
.</p>
<p>I just presented a poster about it at the <a href="https://sbw2023.nu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swedish Bioinformatics
Workshop 2023</a>
 , so perhaps let me first present you
the poster instead of re-iterating what it is (click to view large
version):</p>

<h3 id="new-version-not-requiring-running-the-scicmd-command">New version not requiring running the scicmd command</h3>
<p>I got a lot of great feedback from numerous people at the conference,
most of who pointed out that it would be great if one could start
scicommander as a kind of subshell, inside which one can run commands as
usual, instead of running them via the <code>scicmd -c</code> command.</p>
