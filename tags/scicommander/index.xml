      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t written much about a new tool I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on in some extra time: SciCommander .&#xA;I just presented a poster about it at the Swedish Bioinformatics Workshop 2023 , so perhaps let me first present you the poster instead of re-iterating what it is (click to view large version):&#xA;New version not requiring running the scicmd command I got a lot of great feedback from numerous people at the conference, most of who pointed out that it would be great if one could start scicommander as a kind of subshell, inside which one can run commands as usual, instead of running them via the scicmd -c command.</description>
