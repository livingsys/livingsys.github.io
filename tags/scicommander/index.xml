      <description>When I presented a poster about SciCommander at the Swedish bioinformatics workshop last year, I got a lot of awesome feedback from some great people including Fredrik Boulund, Johannes Alneberg and others, of which I unfortunately lost the names (please shout out if you read this!).&#xA;For those new to SciCommander, it is my attempt at creating a tool that can track complete provenance reports also for ad-hoc shell commands, not just those included in a pipeline.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t written much about a new tool I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on in some extra time: SciCommander .&#xA;I just presented a poster about it at the Swedish Bioinformatics Workshop 2023 , so perhaps let me first present you the poster instead of re-iterating what it is (click to view large version):&#xA;New version not requiring running the scicmd command I got a lot of great feedback from numerous people at the conference, most of who pointed out that it would be great if one could start scicommander as a kind of subshell, inside which one can run commands as usual, instead of running them via the scicmd -c command.</description>
