<h2><a href="/posts/scipipe-at-nasa/">SciPipe used at NASA Glenn Research Center</a></h2>
 I was happy to see the publication finally going online , of work done at NASA Glenn Research Center , where SciPipe has been used to process and track provenance of the analyses, &ldquo;Modeling the impact of thoracic pressure on intracranial pressure&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve known the work existed for a couple of years, …

We just wanted to share that the paper on our Go-based workflow library, SciPipe, was just published in GigaScience:
Abstract Background The complex nature of biological data has driven the development of specialized software tools. Scientific workflow management systems simplify the assembly of such tools into …

Today marked the day when we ran the very first production workflow with SciPipe , the Go -based scientific workflow tool we&rsquo;ve been working on over the last couple of years. Yay! :)
This is how it looked (no fancy GUI or such yet, sorry):
The first result we got in this very very first job was a list of counts …
