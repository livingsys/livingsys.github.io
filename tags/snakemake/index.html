    <h2><a href="/posts/dynamic-workflow-scheduling/">Wanted: Dynamic workflow scheduling</a></h2>
    Photo credits: Matthew Smith / Unsplash In our work on automating machine learning computations in cheminformatics with scientific workflow tools , we have came to realize something; Dynamic scheduling in scientific workflow tools is very important and sometimes badly needed.
What I mean is that new tasks should be able to be scheduled during the execution of a workflow, not just in its scheduling phase.
What is striking is that far from all workflow tools allow this.
