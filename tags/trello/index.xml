      <description>Figure: Sketchy screenshot of how my current board looks. Notice especially the &amp;ldquo;Now&amp;rdquo; stack, marked in yellow, where you are only allowed to put one single card.

I always felt there might be something else that might be more important than what I were currently doing.</description>
