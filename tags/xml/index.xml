      <description>I had a problem in which I thought I needed to parse the full DrugBank dataset, which comes as a (670MB) XML file (For open access papers describing DrugBank, see: [1], [2], [3] and [4]). It turned out what I needed was available as CSV files under &amp;ldquo;Structure External Links &amp;rdquo;. There is probably still some other uses of this approach though, as the XML version of DrugBank seems to contain a lot more information in a single format.</description>
