      <description>ZeroMQ is a great way to quickly and simply send messages between multiple programs running on the same or different computers. It is very simple and robust since it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need any central server. Instead it talks directly between the programs through sockets, TCP-connections or similar.&#xA;ZeroMQ has client libraries for basically all commonly used programming languages, but when testing out that a connection works between e.g. two different machines, it might be good to keep things simple and test just the connection, as simply as possible.</description>
